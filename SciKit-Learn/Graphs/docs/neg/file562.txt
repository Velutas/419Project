 looked internet movie database s awards section film found nominated golden globe best picture drama 
anyone whos seen film can back worst great disaster films thats really saying lot film 
 earthquake basically notable originally included theatre thing theatre shook big earthquake occured 
 video bland slowmoving film gives us bunch different characters disaster film requisite brings together struggle big disaster 
 worked say towering inferno doesnt one single reason dont care characters 
 film gives us charlton heston one many crap s films made including skyjacked classic soylent green rich man married ava gardner little affair young single mom genieveve bujold renegade police officer suspension george kennedy least humored performance second weirdest subplot motorcycle stuntman richard roundtree right shaft thing whose big stunt goes little track goes upside yea snore weirdest subplot military manbag boy grocery store little thing buxom victoria principal eventually gets vengeance guys made fun hair 
 smaller subplots theres pointless bit people flying l city film way one whos playing cards married boring nonacting husband think one can go nowhere 
guess gets interested final frames theres genieveve bujolds moron son little adventure wires muchneeded comedy theres walter matthau billed walter mutha 
 laugh film wild drunkard whos big moment dance critical time 
 actual earthquake rather letdown 
theres full hour charactersetups none interesting minutes shaking crumbling bit house almost falls bujold narrowly missing 
 film needed whole theatreshaking needed wake everybody bored 
theres little suspense following quake although film tries 
theres adventure crumbling highrise office building wires kid movement people injured 
 none alltoo suspenseful 
 finale hestongardnerbujold love triangle ended basic flipofthecoin bit brings big letdown 
 theres real finale 
even volcano ended nicely movie really sucked 
 hokey dont care character 
 cares heston dies 
 cares choses bujold gardner although chosen gardner mainly basis can actually act 
 cares richard roundtree makes money stupid stunt 
 cares idiot kid falls death wires 
 cares whole plane spiel 
 anything earthquake worth viewing reason glen glenda 
 
 mean laughed bio dome 
 thats another story review 
 short earthquake gives disaster pics bad name
