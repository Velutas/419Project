comments house haunted hill based upon original film title directed william castle starring vincent price 
 obvious homage millionaires name price sports thin mustache like price used 
 pretty bad horror film yet bad horror films sometimes entertaining house haunted hill just film 
 surprisingly better another recent haunted house remake haunting film owes basis classic horror novel shirley jackson 
 haunting literary pretensions fell flat face 
house haunted hill owes lineage bmovie years old makes illusion crappy horror movie 
thus somehow proves slightly successful 
 cant think another recent film eclectic cast 
 cast lifts hohum thriller borderline entertaining exercise camp horror 
price main character played geoffrey rush academyaward winning actor shine 
rush seems making downward spiral movie industry spiral reminiscent ben ghandi schindlers list kingsleys ridiculous appearance camp scifi classic species 
 dont know sometimes entertaining see quality actors bad movies 
 surprises 
rising star taye diggs plays stereotypical african american sports figure rather lamely singer lisa loeb 
appears tv news reporter 
 highlight cast however saturday night live member chris kattan 
kattans comic sense provides several good humorous moments plays hysterical proprietor former sanitarium 
 first half film leaves audience guessing whats exactly going second half dissolves standard ghost story stuff loses suspense 
 disappointingly cheesy ending really mars movie 
house haunted hill suspect just left secondrun theaters 
 worth catching cable next year get chance 
 choice pick movie haunting better two evils say 
though appropriately perhaps itd better say better two turkeys
