 seems ive stopped enjoying movies fun watch 
take payback example movie people seem like 
however horrible schlock straight hollywoods vast talent sucking creativity movies 
 written directed guy done better however maybe better percent movie isnt 
mel gibson hollywood zombie decided didnt like ending another director reshoot 
 crock 
 sign movie way script calls 
 film movie look later say changed mind dont like ending 
youre fired 
lets get someone else 
 suppose honor dead hollywood 
 end film course hollywoodized 
 say happy guy root beats impossible odds win prize 
 case victories hollywood movies gibsons prize blond money 
 miss originality film really 
 think audiences starved theyll flop lot money hopes movie will original 
paybacks tagline get ready root bad guy promised original idea far truth 
 gibsons character certainly broke law character honor odd gibson seems little wouldnt kill front children protects blond woman 
theres nothing bad hes hollywood character person never exist real life 
 gibson knows spends time trying act like bad guy instead comes pretentious arrogant 
 story involves gibson doublecrossed partner real bad guy made wish root 
gibson recovers multiple gunshots pissed naturally will whatever takes get exact amount money back less 
 makes point strictly grand 
 real bad guy made expartner pay interest 
 idea completely stretched 
gibson ends going partner chicago mafia partner affiliated 
 didnt understand chicago mafia 
 like spare change 
theyd probably just pay guy rather go trouble dealing 
 think theyd respect guy going much trouble simple 
maybe im hard movie 
perhaps filmmakers just trying make simple popcorn movie 
 read roger eberts review liked gibson role comic heart playing bad guy 
thats allowed root 
 true gibson walks movie hes smiling joke just heard 
 hes wrong 
 wanted lee marvin oldtime clint eastwood somebody wasnt comic just ass kicker 
 side note ive just checked internet movie database discovered th person post newsgroup review payback 
 many reviews anyone want read 
really dont care 
im just trying gain membership online film critics society posting many reviews can
