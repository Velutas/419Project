mm written seven scribe andrew kevin walker interesting idea ruined hollywood formula become bog standard murder mystery 
nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles asked upper class toff mrs christian myra carter investigate movie found recently deceased husbands safe 
 movie happens mythical snuff movie girl featured film appears get brutally slashed 
 mrs christian wants know girl film killed 
welles agrees soon gets pulled seedy underworld porn movies video clerk max california phoenix guide 
although snuff industry hasnt really examined mainstream cinema mm still makes rather plodding thriller just seems bit sicker 
 snuff movie within movie certainly disturbing although jerky camera angles grainy image takes shock away 
mm problem wanting shock much apart moments action film nothing havent seen another standard thriller 
 cast help towards entertainment apart hideous performance increasingly lazy nicolas cage 
 fun breezy earlier films raising arizona ever since leaving las vegas cage lost much acting talent appears autopilot terrible snake eyes 
 mm hes boring uninteresting dull monotonous voice 
 overlong thriller virtues help keep suspense 
 cage onscreen excellent phoenix film start moving phoenix true talent 
 performance great break away gloom hes just purely enjoyable watch 
catherine keener completely wasted cages wife although delivers far better performance character deserves 
 character though hugely underwritten one wasted characters year 
also fun fargos peter stormare wildly top snuff film director 
 film written person behind seven mm filled doom gloom noone appears know use light switch 
unlike seven mm isnt clever twist pathetic startlingly obvious arrives 
lacking strong characters seven featured mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise relies graphic scenes provide entertainment 
 director joel schumacher completely wrong guy job puts style content direction look good just disturbing 
schumacher also idea shock audience though meant looking dark belly porn industry doesnt exactly leave haunting impression viewers mind misses point 
also last minutes hackneyed cliched amazing think film youre watching 
mm far success snuffed opportunity 
 boring lead character controversial scenes manage controversial director obsessed looks one shocking films year dumb thriller 
ultimately mm probably worth renting home video unless desperate see snuff film within film looks like 
 trust rest hours worth
