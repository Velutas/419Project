maybe mission scrubbed 
mission mars 
 film review michael redman copyright michael redman 
theres world difference artists technicians 
 artist vision create something new 
 may well might sloppy something youve never seen 
 good technician can make look good without direction inner artist someone else going just xerox 
obviously successful films need skills 
brian de palma masterful technician 
hes spent career copying others notably hitchcock 
 usually knows exactly make scene work learned rote 
aside rare flashes originality films often souldead 
 de palmas latest turns attention stanley kubrick 
 tell truth enjoyed portions movie liked lot better years ago called 
 enjoyed even titled close encounters 
nasa set sights mars 
 first crew meets disaster rescue mission sent red planet 
 dont well either eventually meet lone surviving astronautgonerasta solve mysteries universe 
 boring 
 many scenes just dont work difficult begin 
 first crew feet away raging massive upsidedown martian tornado looks remarkably like sandworm dune destroying everything path just hang watching 
error 
 interesting character thats saying much killed 
error 
 alien laughable 
error 
 rest characters dullest people imaginable 
error 
theres nice eyecandy 
 face mars turns giant metal thai buddha head looks cool 
 threedimensional holographic planetarium fun watch anything disney world 
maneuvering space suits outside ship seems realistic 
 theres much feels weve 
 theres rotating space station blinding white room 
 close encounters solve sound puzzle play aliens 
 list goes 
 actors mostly mobile wooden statues 
even gary sinise tim robbins cant muster enough emotion convince us breathing 
 one seems care anything happens 
 wont either 
 absolutely worst sin blatant product placement dr pepper foot tall logo saves day 
 save commercials insipid bits film
