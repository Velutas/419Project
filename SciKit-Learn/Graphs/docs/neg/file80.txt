 years ago japanese production company called toho introduced land rising sun gojira reptilian creature immense proportions created mankinds nuclear testing 
partly flight fancy partly commentary exploitation atomic power weaponry gojira emerged ocean terrorize tokyo 
 year later gojira marketed united states adding three things new name dubbed english track raymond burr 
 godzilla film took rest world 
thirty years later toho remade classic film took american market adding three things yes including raymond burr called godzilla 
now years tohos remake director roland emmerich allowed giant lizard make american first run 
 emmerichs godzilla matthew broderick plays dr niko tatopoulos biologist called join scientists south pacific already studying existence radiationinduced super mutant leaves footprints size livingrooms 
 mutant reptile suddenly appears hudson river tatopoulos rest team relocate back states 
meanwhile tatopouloss college girlfriend audrey timmonds maria pitillo works new york city assistant bigtime news reporter 
shed like reporter godzilla comes ashore figures big break 
 course big guy running amok city niko audrey bound cross paths joined victor animal palotti hank azaria audreys trusty cameraman friend phillipe roche jean reno operative french government whose nuclear testing started whole problem first place 
together attempt find destroy surprisingly elusive godzilla 
 resources cutting edge special effects houses clout one nations premiere movie production companies one think emmerich make film truly deserving name godzilla 
 didnt 
right lost world godzilla one biggest disappointments recent cinematic history 
 plot pretty much expect big dinosaurlike creature comes water starts smashing new york city heroes figure thing rampage can stopped military makes futile attempts bring creature 
 script however painfully bad 
 fraught lines corny dont even belong bmovies includes many character actions make think idiot stupid girl 
 suppose youve got movie giant lizard loose new york semblance reality goes window well 
 godzilla topples buildings merely brushing conveniently able leap atop others 
 helicopters follow godzilla flying dangerously buildings can lose sight easily keep track flying little higher straight line 
 sidewinder missiles small explosive warheads blow entire buildings miss godzilla 
 mission bomb madison square garden carried three f fighterbombers flights aircraft always comprised multiples two 
okay maybe last one bit nitpicky hey roll 
broderick usually good actor film hes weighed unexciting character atrocious screenplay seem fight every step way 
hank azaria can dont expect see development promise showed birdcage 
like brodericks azarias character quite simply lacking color 
 really annoyed maria pitillo actually takes bad script makes worse acting 
casting must asleep one 
 one bright spot jean reno oddly enough seems fit well role often comedic quite unlike weve seem past 
although character contradictory unfolding disaster reno brings style role phillipe makes enjoyable 
unfortunately said incongruities 
 entire feel movie tongueincheek seems pay comical homage dozen films come 
 results significant amount parody contrasts sharply threat monster ends just producing mess 
 characters seem comic relief almost none smart enough audience take seriously 
although emmerich obviously wanted make fun action picture good sink millions cgi creature whose ferocity undermined humans threatens 
 cant take characters seriously threat face empty one simply dont care happens 
godzilla simply pulls many punches attempt film lighthearted 
far want see carnage theaters heres behemoth running city 
theres bound lot casualties instead godzilla afflicted afterschool g 
joe cartoon syndrome almost everyone seems get harms way just time 
 couple scenes godzilla briefly breathes fire 
none characters even remark upon ability used particular advantage filmmakers 
 special effects people just wanted show yes godzilla can just like old movie 
consider another punch pulled 
 creative script writing can make sequel just movie final scene one doesnt just leave door open opens hallway leading directly room godzilla ii waiting patiently 
 made want gag 
emmerich done away humor injokes played one straight action film 
 intelligently written screenplay godzilla much 
however confusing viewer ton addins parodies movie ends something just doesnt work 
now raymond burr
