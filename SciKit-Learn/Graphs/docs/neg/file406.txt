arnold schwarzenegger icon action enthusiasts since late s lately films sloppy oneliners getting worse 
 hard seeing arnold mr freeze batman robin especially says tons ice jokes hey got million whats matter 
 arnold signed another expensive blockbuster cant compare likes terminator series true lies even eraser 
 called dark thriller devil gabriel byrne come upon earth impregnate woman robin tunney happens every years basically destroy world apparently god chosen one man one man jericho cane arnold 
 help trusty sidekick kevin pollack will stop nothing let devil take world 
parts actually absurd fit right dogma 
yes film weak better blockbuster right now sleepy hollow makes world enough look like star film 
anyway definitely doesnt seem like arnold movie 
 just wasnt type film can see 
sure gave us chuckles well known oneliners seemed confused character film going 
 understandable especially ending changed according sources 
aside form still walked much like past films 
im sorry say arnold maybe end action days 
speaking action film 
 hardly explosions fights 
 devil made places explode arnold wasnt kicking devil butt 
 ending changed make spiritual undoubtedly ruined film 
 least hoping cool ending nothing else occurred let 
 also dont know film took long cost much 
 really super affects unless consider invisible devil minutes tops worth overpriced budget 
 budget gone better script least audiences somewhat entertained instead facing boredom 
 pitiful see scripts like get bought made movie 
 even read things anymore 
 sure doesnt seem like 
thankfully gabriels performance gave light poor film 
 walks street searching robin tunney cant help feel looked like devil 
 guy creepy looking anyway 
 youre just glad end movie 
dont bother see youre expecting solid action flick neither solid action 
 just another movie suckered seeing due strategic marketing campaign 
save money see world enough entertaining experience
