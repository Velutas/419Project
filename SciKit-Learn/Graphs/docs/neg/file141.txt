 last line near honor great butler alfred ubergod michael gough saying think need bigger bat cave something note 
thats exactly film big good damn much 
cut batgirl 
cut one villains 
 much handle one dosage 
 much characters get left behind 
poor elle gets mere scenes subplot introduced never finished way shape form 
 elle deserves better 
 fourth gigantic film series second director joel schumacher 
 also fourth worst series second worst joel 
 series declining since stunning debut followed almostasstunning sequel anticlimactic third one first joel 
 ones anticlimactic knew gonna suck 
 joel make fun though 
 batman forever fun 
 big bore overproduced action sequences shallow characters 
 mean one bit 
im gonna put plot one paragraph mr freeze ahnold whos wife dying disease become new big villain days 
hes huge exscientist fell weird liquid hello 
joker now body temperature big fat zero blue body 
batman george robin chris fight bit find theyre growing apart 
meanwhile another villain shows poison ivy uma dorky scientist chick working flowers south america twistet scientist john glover kills finds hes used research develop uberman bane basically man pumped chemicals probably killed personality ever 
 emerges chemicals dont ask cause cant tell ya sexy woman real uma whos poison kiss aphrodiasiatic scent blows people 
 starts tear away dynamic duo 
meanwhile alfreds dying disease mr freezes wife earlier state niece barbara alicia comes way oxford without english accent get away butler trade soon well really soon takes hours becomes batgirl 
meanwhile unfinished subplot bruce batmans alterego forgot dating lovely julie madison even lovlier elle macpherson wants commitment year says nothing 
end know 
mr freeze ultimately teams poison ivy want freeze world take growing new plants population dont ask 
 trio must team together family beat 
 ya go 
 whole story big context clues 
 much right 
right 
 films seems patched together nice little ideas made couple good sequels 
however tim burton nicely balanced villainbatman storyline although wonderfully joel seems almost nothing batman one 
 gets corny speeches couple clever lines thats 
maybe stunts 
 cant even comment george clooney batman hardly saw guy 
 horrible dialogue say 
 think michael keaton quintessential batman val kilmer robotic fake batman last episode 
george 
hes quintessential hes horrible hes good 
 im sure next time decide renovate series since theyll critically murdered sorry effort well get good script clooney will shine still job 
 villains interesting part series according schumacher 
last time brawn two face played tommy lee jones brainscomedy supplied riddler realized jim carrey 
 time somewhat sympathetic somewhat hatable villain guy mr freeze 
 feel bad mentalphysical collapse really need kill everyone plants 
arnold isnt good hokey kinda sympathetic points 
 watches old movies wife actually looks somber 
wow 
 uma makes seductive character getting right point hamminess seductiveness 
 like shes almost parodying pulp fiction points 
shes incredibly hot makes movie pretty much star better 
 lower batpeople chris batman forever although think work hokey hes best quieter parts scent woman just plain cool parts fried green tomotoes 
alicia love girl shes particularly good film 
 can hypotheitically act saw clueless lines kinda sound weird 
 isnt mushymouth time 
 fairness virtually part 
joel gets around occasionally shes stupid stuff although 
 know im one loved catfight uma 
 poor elle 
poor poor elle 
 love woman can also hypothetically act us saw sirens 
 part 
 seems like joel much footage edit almost hour final product 
 couch scenes like best friend noticed 
now listen one every batman flick theres couch scene 
 original vicki 
 returns good makeout scene selena 
 last one chat nicole 
 one nothing 
 batgirl nexttonothing film till end shes suddenly part family 
fortunately get lot alfred 
hes always reliable butler case didnt know bruce life 
hes god 
hes father figure 
hes also dying 
 got 
 love alfred almost much bruce see robe tux freaking dying just gets 
 also get idea might unhappy whole time 
 never answered film cluttered 
 defense good parts uma 
 one george good batman unfortunately gets nothing 
 nice touches 
 show asylum one point show patients belongings room see riddlers costume 
 laughed 
 biker scene involving robin batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period see coolio bunch badasses dressed droogs clockwork orange 
 laughed 
 film falls apart around fiveminute mark enormously long action sequence must last around minutes 
 just feel like 
 film serve another longline films demonstrate need intelligent films nowadays 
people fed stupid films 
thats word mouth killed lost world 
thats last year indy films grossed ever 
thats will strong boxoffice initative people just want see like will die week two word around grapevine kills 
thats next two bigbudget aciton pics john woos faceoff barry sonnenfelds men black first two catch wave early 
 like joel schumacher person artiste 
 like films flatliners time kill lot suck 
hes really eccentric person loved one quotes admits mediocre director thats makes great 
 costuming woody allens sleeper interesting one costuming cool look nazi number 
 love batman series 
 first two rocked like last one 
 one going one watch repeatedly like three 
hopefully will also serve springboard better batman next time 
 maybe theyll get smart bring back catwoman 
 michael keaton 
 can hope
