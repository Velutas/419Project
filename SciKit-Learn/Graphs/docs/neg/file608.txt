 feel sorry financial backers waterworld supposedly expensive film ever made million also one stupidest boy get ripped 
 fact film really movie amusement park ride plot 
 even just another case cliches strung together well something thats painful watch relishes flaws 
kevin costner stars man kind mutant half manhalf fish 
 explorermariner alternate earth completely covered water polar ice caps melted 
hes referred mariner meaner appropriate title hes cold rigid strict hes supposed good guy 
 docks small floating village sorts 
 trades dirt money introduces us important characters 
first meet one villains soontobe heroine child prodigy wacky inventor group primitive people somehow technology today also lowtech tools used pirates vikings 
immediately films biggest flaw apparent people primitive highly advanced 
 doesnt seem like anyone can read yet skidoos airplanes 
 things powered 
 airplanes couldnt just keep flying reached dry land 
also planet completely covered water get materials make things 
im sorry im checking brain door going movies elements like go unnoticed draw attention away story confuse us 
 potential good pirate story set medieval times modern technology mix two together 
 doesnt make sense 
 really isnt much plot story moves quickly never takes time explain anything 
 thing learn prodigy child enola mojorino tattoo back supposedly map dryland 
 put tattoo come taken long figure 
 never get answer just stupid action movie whoever can get girl will victor sorts reach dryland 
 make long boring stupid just plain bad story short mariner escapes woman named helen tripplehorn enola 
 sail long time encountering strange people process fight smokers lead idiot villain deacon hopper kidnaps enola 
 story becomes overly grand adventure mariner taking army goons rescuing enola bringing salvation original 
even special effects action adventure film boring 
 single character likable therefore neither plot 
dennis hopper completely rips jack nicholsons joker costner just plain rips 
still waterworld professionally made good production design original idea substance 
 just hope dont make sequel
