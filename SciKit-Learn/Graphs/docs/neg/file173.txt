watching movie vowed subtract half star review filmmakers included saccharine syrup cute n cuddly computergenerated monkey 
 monkey died movie got extra half star 
alas monkey showed end unharmed wet sickly sound gagging rolling eyeballs 
 means lost space actually deserved stars 
thats pretty generous considering movies camp lacked hint tongue cheek 
 will robinson jack johnson teaches pet robot friendship actually supposed buy 
 seemingly high rating 
 reasons made unable throw away experience garbage 
first saw movie opening night first day operation brand new theater 
 sound screen kicked ass 
nobody country enjoyed movie much audience dont necessarily mean good way 
also zero scenes found rooting robinsons getting caught movies tension 
 even liked computergenerated settings 
 usually prefer see models sets cg detailed ive seen lot movies looks like someone spent little overtime render futuristic cities 
also gary oldman never bad actor even though typecast villain 
william hurt isnt bad either 
neither actor great role performances watchable 
 perhaps shouldnt admit something tone outlook movie brought back childhood 
 little swearing blood strong moral message saccharine though bit romance whose culmination hours real kiss sex 
 felt like one disney movies looked forward six 
 movies probably bad lost space time manna heaven 
 type moviemaking lost art 
now bad news 
worst unforgivable incredibly bad dialogue 
 squeakyclean family fun trying hard hip pulp fiction 
 better hold joystick one line 
 robinson called upon deliver line warp conduit thingamajigs inevitably stumble badly enough embarrass even lowliest star trek ensign 
second worst closely related screenplay 
 storys exposition takes place press conference allows writers explain whats happening least amount creativity effort interest 
 story gets going concede momentary burst interest whole situations arise silly contrived 
 gary oldman easily reprograms wills pet robot kill robinsons friend summed perfectly flipped switch evil 
 theres tone movie 
 colorado daily said film interesting central character will robinson father john robinson 
 adventure movie 
theyre mostly right except johnson will wasnt good enough actor carry 
still film robinson patriarch hero shows lack imagination 
just movie tame enough kids doesnt mean bow promise keepers notion whos center family 
many quality family films made nontraditional family structure fly away home comes mind much better effect 
 politics time seem bit conservative regressive futuristic movie 
 star wars rebels good guys 
 rooting fighting system 
 lost space rebels bad guys terrorist force must killed crushed silenced children may live free 
 ominous excuse violence almost makes sympathize terrorists 
finally specific details deserve criticism 
 movie tells us setting year 
 
 bother saying year 
just tell us future 
 bring tv series supposed take place 
setting specific date dates movie guarantees wont timeless movie really running anyway 
 scene shows john robinson checking one controls chair rises fifteen feet pole 
 silly waste money reminded bugs bunnys barber chair shows future time spaceship designers havent learned thing ergonomics 
one vaguely redeeming quality end credits succeed rest film failed made lost space look cool 
 strong techno beat sampled cheesiest dialogue context made sound hip 
 overlaid cool jumpy credit sequence interesting distorted clips movie 
 thats best part movie cant good conscience recommend 
still get stuck seeing might able appreciate keep distance think liking bad movies child bring along bad movie bingo cards
