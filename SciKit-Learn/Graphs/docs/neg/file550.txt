cradle will rock latest effort directoractor tim robbins 
 may oscar worthy film back dead man walking gets little overconfident sloppy 
 story confusing filled many subplots ill try best explain simply possible 
 film based mostly true story federal theater s produced play cradle will rock apparently offensive government shuts 
 time depression theater wants entertain cheer jobs poor 
 conflict lies seems like subplots work theater associated 
also along way messages mashed together create even overwhelming experience 
tim robbins just keeps piling political views characters just give film cases walk 
 robbins may nice achievement seemed like friendly get together slightly sophisticated dialogue fancy outfits 
 thought main reason seeing film outstanding cast unfortunately uninteresting except 
let recap important character please bear least can especially considering seeing 
ill begin involved play 
theres orson welles angus macfadyen course director play producer john houseman cary elwes marc blitzstein hank azaria writer play emily watson woman gets break playing main part cradle will rock 
outside play theres ventriloquist bill murray wants relationship federal theater clerk joan cusack another subplot involving painter diego rivera ruben blades whos unhappy painting destroyed nelson rockefeller feels outrage john cusack 
theres actresses actors stories susan sarandon philip baker hall name mentioned significant story 
anyway talented hollywood stars completely wasted except emily watson another great job one personal favorite actors john cusack always delivers thick thin 
now although film weak say least nice moments involving subjects overblown 
sure free speech segment nice feature becomes repetitive 
 whole film like basically nothing headache 
 brighter side tim robbins direction masterful 
 camera direction seemed reminiscent works paul thomas andersons latest magnolia smoother opinion even cant make movie much better 
although moments many theyre cradle will rock stays true title cradle rocked far tipped
