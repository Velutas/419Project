 american werewolf london john landis groundbreaking feature american tourist gets bitten werewolf jolly old england 
 groundbreaking part movie special effects 
 specifically makeup used transformation man werewolf ghosts haunt main character 
even twenty years release part movie still impressive 
although say really part movie considered impressive 
 rest movie run mill werewolf flick extra gore thrown good measure 
 werent cutting edge makeup effects used werewolf transformation likely film gone largely unnoticed released back 
 good reason acting isnt great neither writing 
well ok dont actually expect either things great horror film 
 one important element lacking isnt scary 
 exception know going happen happens 
 dont even need obligatory scary music give hint 
 will give director john landis credit one best looking horror films ever seen 
 john just wasnt scary 
 didnt know intended sort romantic drama whole werewolf thing just thrown get people come theater see didnt work 
actually intended sort spoof horror films 
 mix comedic moments melodrama bad intended humor lost 
 never good sign dont realize movie supposed funny movie long read background material 
call crazy shouldnt research movie enjoy 
im even going get plot movie much since title pretty well sums whole thing 
werewolf bites boy david naughton 
boy ends hospital tended eventually falls pretty nurse jenny agutter strange things begin happen boy 
including must admit nice touch visits friend killed werewolf attack ended hospital 
 neat thing buddy rapidly deteriorating corpse 
 know sounds strange actually works 
 scenes david naughton dead buddy griffin dunne really best parts movie 
 said probably reason film hit special effects 
 still impressive today arent impressive enough plentiful enough warrant watching film 
 since less highlight film far better choices want scary movie curl sweetheart watch 
actually sequel american werewolf paris entertaining since doesnt take seriously actually provides laughs along way
