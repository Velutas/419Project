 good thing animated scifi movies come japan titan e proof hollywood doesnt clue 
 dont know film supposed 
 can tell young man named kale whos one last survivors earth early st century unknowingly possesses key saving regenerating left human race 
thats fine premise actionpacked scifi animated movie theres payoff 
 story takes main characters galaxy search legendary ship evil dredge aliens want destroy apparent reason 
 process get lot spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights doublecrosses can shake stick 
theres much pointless scifi banter much take 
 galaxy total ripoff star wars universe creators dont bother filling basic details makes story confusing characters unmotivated superficial plot just plain boring 
despite fantastic animation special effects just interesting movie
