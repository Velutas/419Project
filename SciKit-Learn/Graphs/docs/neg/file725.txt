 soldier director paul anderson film presence originality fleeting 
 best moments film opning scenes kurt russels character todd shown growing strict military supervision 
brutality eyes innocent stripped every single day growing something lot emotional potential power behind opening scenes tap little 
 goes nowhere idea 
 perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards deals potential trauma dehumanization rest film just biggest action movie cliches ive ever seen 
 whole idea inhuman soldiertype character gaining degree humanity defending potential female love interest family evil counterpart kill done done much better 
 able predict plot whole story wouldnt bad aspect film somewhat interesting 
 action sequences tries deal aforementioned issues humanity performance mr russel film tiny little window soul eyes since dialog extremely limited 
 performance way isnt bad certainly enough carry film 
 performances film really worth much mention generally weak characters 
 enough stuff plot character right 
isnt important part action film well action 
even aspect film disappointment 
 mortal kombat director paul anderson proved truly engaging use choreography action film can override problems plot produce something entertaining 
however fails repeat film 
 combat scenes particularly big one end incredibly unimaginatve 
fighting combat scenes supposed bring thrills type movie point even otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed realize 
 instead reaching something truly interesting end film goes old shootem one guy vs army type cinema thought died military action films s 
 film went ideas opened introduction seriously rather engaging science fiction film 
however utterly failed go new directions making film big disappointment
