 disney sink much cash corky hype machine 
honestly hoping goofball ads actually front decently funny movie 
man wrong 
corky romano one throwaway clich ridden tvstartofilm vehicles built upon rickety plots 
fortunately chris kattans precariously positioned career corky good laughs even lowestbrow variety 
kattan plays title character unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky penchant sunshiny s tunes bright ties banal coffee mug slogans dont crazy work sure helps 
 mob boss dad peter falk put away murder charges bungling lughead brothers peter berg chris penn rope innocent black sheep corky infiltrate fbi agent steal evidence 
predictably hijinks ensue 
 basic plot sounds bad wait get innerworkings clunker 
 writers will amaze depth inanity 
corkys fbi agent identity named corky pissant thats pronounced peesahn 
 french 
 becomes firstrate agent accidentally stumbling mr magoostyle onto proper clues talking way situations plays like something sitcom 
 good sitcom mean 
 romano family brothers even insult farting others face 
 scene taken straight theres something mary corky gives dachshund mouthtomouth resuscitation 
 complete disaster 
 manic kattan occasionally rescue comic moments including bit featuring cat fat suit named jesus another involving schoolchildren german shephard kilo cocaine 
plus berg whose career obviously gone downhill since last seduction chicago hope gives great turn illiterate brother paulie 
 nice see richard roundtree shaft fame getting work

 next time one pesky ads appears tv asking corky 
 can simply reply cares
