im sure silvio horta wrote urban legend success scream im guessing just seems may time write second draft 
seriously ideaa psycho bumping people style urban legendsis great one wish pulled 
 first sign trouble comes painfully insipid dialogue 
 example car crash mustve awful 
everyone involved 
 can tell writer intended something little airy supposed said just one figured 
 know slasher movies isnt supposed lot great characterization dont mind cardboard cutouts please dont let cutouts damn bland 
one reason movies like scream star wars diva become treasured feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters 
aside jared leto joshua jackson arent screen long enough one urban legend makes grade 
alicia witt shows none acerbity wit displayed cybill rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive mention dumb post film robert englund just cruises auto pilot 
good thing brad dourif wait hes movie five minutes hes just redoing goodnatured stuttering character one flew cuckoos nest 
 brings another aspect urban legend unoriginality 
 film blatantly ripped scream another reason makes think silvio horta wrote cravens williamsons great success 
urban legend tries deconstruct modernday folklore much way scream deconstructed slasher films doesnt quite succeed 
 best stab selfreflexivity poking fun girl noxzeema ad ie rebecca gayheart also another killertauntinghisvictimonthephone routine urban legend quick movie exchange dialogue 
female protagonist 
villain 
 
congratulations answered scream andor urban legend 
like said movie couldve great 
 silvio worked allowed work little longer script 
still least urban legend pretty cool death scenes somewhat realized whodunit angle makes slasher waaaayyyyyy better know last summer
