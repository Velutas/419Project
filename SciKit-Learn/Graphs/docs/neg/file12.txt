janeane garofalo romantic comedy good idea couple years ago truth cats dogs almost excruciating matchmaker 
 bythebooks movie plods along predestined course surprises laughs 
 also jumps everpopular political satire bandwagon manages fall flat 
garofalo plays campaign aide massacusetts senator jay o sanders running reelection 
denis leary plays stereotypical strategist ethics decides way scandal plagued senator win play irish roots cash boston roman catholic democrat contingent thats made kennedy family popular 
 leary orders garofalo go ireland dig relatives exploit 
 soon learns easier said done mantra movies like 
 matchmaker falls every cliche things can go wrong garofalo take tiny plane ireland almost misses bus town cant get hotel room ends smallest trashiest one around dog piss luggage 
 comes roger ebert calls meet cute 
 happens every romance man woman meet first time unconventional cinematic way 
 matchmaker happens garofalo walks hotel bathroom finds nude sean david ohara bathtub dog sitting side 
 points guessing dog just made water luggage 
also points guessing garofalo hates ohara sight 
thats works movies like 
 know instant saw irishman bathtub shed hate awhile succumb charms live happily reel allowing superficial detail throw relationship turmoil theyd reconcile time happy irish tune play end credits 
 havent mentioned movies twist yet 
garofalo comes small ireland town annual matchmaking festival lonely folks around county pair future bliss 
milo oshea looks like irish tom snyder matchmaker pops onscreen occasionally spew words wisdom bring lonely souls together 
rest assured hell can match garofalo ohara 
oh keeping matchmakers utter predictability dies toward end 
 message 
sometimes even respectable person comedic distinction like garofalo will sell weak script 
 excited see garofalo leary movie actually two three scenes together 
leary stays stateside part yelling garofalo phone generally asshole 
 even undoes old microphones still hes done giving speech cliche 
 known better
