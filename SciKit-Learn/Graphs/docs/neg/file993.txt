 clan cave bear clearly tries capitalize hannah selling point poster art bears striking closeup hannah tribal paint video box prominently features name lettering size title 
 even starring role turkey unfortunately can save unbelievable exercise cheese 
 uniquely bad film dealing prehistoric man actually tries miserably fails serious oddly fascinating 
 ridiculous attempt drama leaves audience somehow transfixed wanting see dud plays 
 clan cave bear based upon popular novel jean m auel 
 day book possesses loyal cult following 
 remember dear friend mine dogeared copy novel read child socalled dirty parts blacked marker grandmother 
 never read book sure hope times better film adaptation 
 im complete loss explain popularity 
 clan cave bear immediately opens comically absurd scene 
 young ayla looking much like drew barrymore e t 
tramps woods 
 cute little ponytails fur wrapped audiences expectations convincing portrayal prehistory immediately shattered 
 follows laughably choreographed sequence earthquake swallows aylas mother blonde fur pants er 
leggings 
tearful ayla looks cameraman shakes camera well 
 earthquake slowly recedes 
 hungry lion becomes interested lunch screaming sixyearold manages outrun king wild find safe haven 
 wont detail story seems enough illustrate point 
 movie really stupid 
 never even gives audience chance suspend disbelief 
also obvious comparison appearance cromagnon man prehistory rise feminism century subtle burning wonderbra front charlton heston 
 movie doesnt just suggest message whacks message audience twobyfour 
 blond gorgeous woman challenges social laws bunch people gaudy brown wigs 
shes new people theyre old people memories

 clan cave bear apparently received academy award nomination best makeup surprises 
 movie depends upon lot makeup obviously much unconvincing 
 stated daryl hannah daryl hannah looks like just stepped shower time 
 rest characters dark makeup sort smeared look like dirt 
 facepainting thats occasionally seen perhaps notable work mind 
 movie also suffers new age trappings 
maybe music sounded lot fresh original now sounds dated cliched like poorly conceived elevator music 
add films fauxmysticism including spirit animals dream visions narrator sounds like psychic youd expect hear number get movie serious problems serious 
 clan cave bear rated r though probably one inoffensive offensive films ive seen quite 
 contains several scenes sex sans nudity 
 violence mostly consists hunting scenes 
 funniest moment movie occurs neanderthal love ayla attempts rescue ferocious bear 
 bear bites head audience sees rolling 
although may sound gratuitous im sure cheesy probably wont bother people 
 clan cave bear bad movie 
however wrote beginning review distinction originality 
typically think bottomofthebarrel films dealing early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs exist time man raquel welch come mind 
 clan cave bear tries hard serious though bad audience still interested unique setting characters movie awarded turkey two stars 
 think fans book disappointed film version however im basing observation fact book almost invariably better movie 
 shudder think otherwise
