 remember really enjoying movie saw years ago 
 guess memory really sucks 
 little funny caddyshack 
 laughs far really arent great 
caddyshack name implies less centers one young caddy working exclusive country club 
michael okeefe plays said caddy 
 cast unknown fairly untalented actor lead role completely beyond 
 movie doesnt seem real plot just series scenes little opportunities rest cast mug camera 
 real story can call subplot involving mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray private little war gopher ruining course 
 marginal laughs come rodney dangerfield ted knight mugging overacting camera painfully limited success 
bill murray slightly amusing places fairly wasted 
 biggest waste chevy chase didnt even crack smile face characters lame zenlike approach golfing 
 decent scenes involving interaction dangerfield knight far infrequent carry movie 
 guess thats get basing story around unknown kid 
im sure writers thing thinking really think something far removed comedy putting pen paper 
nothing movie works 
 wouldnt taken genius figure thing wasnt going fly 
 scenes just couldnt possibly funny 
 writers little brain damaged world 
im sure scenes involving chevy chase oneness golf ball supposed funny 
 reality painfully embarrassing watch 
 scene club pool caddies go wild hot babe movie walking bikini 
olive oil filled swimsuit better girl 
everything movie just completely implausible far comedy concerned 
maybe drunk mind high sort illegal narcotic thing might funny 
 rest us stay hell away caddyshack
