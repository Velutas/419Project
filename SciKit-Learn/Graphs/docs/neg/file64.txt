americas sweethearts opposite reality train wreck tries sell julia scruffy alsoran presumably wears hornrimmed glasses used overweight uhhuh 
 plot follows two married megamovie stars gwen eddie zetajones poor poor john cusack whose material gets worse every year eve new star vehicles release film called time time 
 problem gwen eddie gone nasty separation press public forgiving think meg dennis

americas sweethearts jokes arent funny pace choppy whole affair comes vanity project headlining star julia roberts billy crystal deliver bunch lame punch lines wrote 
 didnt time movies bad crystal really screen time unequivocal focus film 
bad move billy jokes suck 
 crotch humor outpaced meanness movies gags unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping every scene movie earned pg rating mystery 
julia overcame lot spiteful writing acting make best friends wedding winning film even tooth smile can save 
obviously aware ugliness director joe roth turns goofy supporting characters like hank azaria lisping spaniard christopher walken insane time time director alan arkin new age guru fright wig crack wise 
none stereotypes successful except walken azaria comes preening queen hes supposed macho 
 roth case dont know went direcing revenge nerds ii launching movie studio revolution produced work 
hes back behind camera first time years 
itll probably another hes back 
 drone americas sweethearts will appeal mouthbreathing morons talk cell phones movies get old 
instead ill settle discussing movies worst sin sweethearts painfully contrived wholly unbelievable just plot sentiment 
every single character film arguable exception kiki simply hateful putting romantic comedy waste bunch villains 
 leave theater youll ask want jerks happy
