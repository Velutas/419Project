preposterous religious action film produced trinity broadcasting network code hidden within text bible deciphered will lead end world nice bible authors put doomsday code read book ever eh 
michael york plays millionaire diplomat breaks code sets become god earth fulfill doomsday prophecies casper van dien terribly miscast giving awful performance result plays atheist motivational speaker must stop 
michael ironside great always despite silly film surrounding plays fallen priest right hand man michael yorks character 
heres subtle character development may missed pertaining ironsides character 
now despite fact see murder man opening scene filmmakers arent quite sure audience will understand evil 
 fix 
make specific efforts show character one film smokes 
 lots ominous shots michael ironside smoking 
oooooo scary 
 even wasnt enough filmmakers apparently later infer ironsides character gay 
 comes nowhere just makes sense 
 main problem film despite silly story pulled 
anything can made believable executed correctly events film arent shown sense urgency importance 
 example one point yorks character declared chancellor world something see one brief cheesy news report 
 movie keeps telling us apocalypse coming never seems way 
theres world reaction anything 
 omega code available dvd goodtimes home video 
 contains film original theatrical aspect ratio includes original theatrical trailer documentary making film production notes cast crew information 
 documentary runs minutes actually surprisingly good looks though made broadcast tbn comprehensive job interviewing practically everyone cast crew exception michael ironside unfortunately 
 best thing whenever crew members interviewed excellent job explaining profession exactly movie set 
 documentaries tend overlook 
doomsday expert hal lindsey even interviewed youll remember documentary s called late great planet earth lindsey speculated jimmy carter might actually antichrist 
however beginning documentary producers film managed get bad side 
 interviewed actually nerve say ever see raiders lost ark 
well film like 
 isnt 
 long shot
