 know never really wondered tarzan films like tarzan old man 
 watching instinct couldnt help acknowledge way film carelessly rehashes wellexplored themes earlier movies 
even beside tarzan comparison instinct just isnt good film 
 painfully idealistic manipulative silly 
 didnt hate simply impossible hate film starring anthony hopkins furthermore acting quite good 
 can recognize instinct beyond subjective admiration actors involved 
 can also recognize reasons wanting make instinct pretty clear good film massive script overhaul director less interested imitating movies like patch adams 
things start predictable way director jon turtletaub introduces us hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr ambitious young psychiatrist supervision experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland 
caulder soon finds involved case life one thinks will make famous 
 subject ethan powell hopkins anthropologist living among gorillas africa past two years 
powell charged brutal murders several men africa now caulders job find hes mentally competent enough stand trial 
 series short sessions caulder tries put together complex psyche powell 
even though really old man version tarzan much central idea rather interesting 
 said hopkins captivating every second hes screen way convincing us hes acting hes actually man just spent two years life living family wild gorillas 
 character isnt interesting hes just anthropologist really likes gorillas hopkins makes interesting subtleties speech action 
gooding jr strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder intelligent flawed individual 
 screenplay written gerald di pego suggested novel daniel quinn gives us background information caulder seems point time friends hes obsessed work 
nonetheless two actors essentially entire list things good instinct 
unfortunately filmmaking inept can mangle effect even best acting 
turtletaub di pego guilty instincts artistic failure work together make dumbest clicheridden environment characters live means brainless subplots 
first prison warden subplot 
 prison warden evil wants stop caulders progress cost means taking caulder powell case thats fine 
theres also prison guard subplot 
 prison guard played john ashton prison guard seems enjoy mercilessly beating upon psychotics supervision hes instrumental helping story along obvious conclusion 
 theres daughter subplot maura tierney playing daughter must look upset lot time daughter deranged man 
 stuff sounds familiar thats theyre devices used reused countless films 
 evil doctor patch adams unlike evil warden 
 offensive caricatures mental patients lack depth similar portrayals one flew cuckoos nest 
ashtons evil prison guard pales comparison clancy browns shawshank redemption 
hopkins performance will undoubtedly remind audiences turn silence lambs 
 theres whole tarzan thing little bit obvious entire film 
perhaps irritates instinct halfhearted attempt philosophical depth 
 message powell brings back wild subtle one thinks humans takers expand kill just live like gorillas 
 can sympathize compelling film 
 kind stupid movie just like patch adams big group characters psychotic inmates case rise evil forces oppressing tearing playing cards 
 man just spent two years life gorillas 
 subplots instinct left cutting room floor thirtyminute movie far superior twohour one watched today 
 central idea developed beyond old man tarzan premise really something interesting movie doesnt rely strength actors
