one s unwelcome thriller trends returns grave hell movie 
starting early nineties subjected nearly every conceivable combination relationshipsfromhell 
 boyfriends hell friendly neighborhood cops hell nannies hell even secretaries hell 
 hush found old standby somehow forgotten rush motherinlaw hell 
 motherinlaw question martha played jessica lange 
 singlehandedly running family horse farm kilronan 
 son jackson johnathon schaech girlfriend helen gwyneth paltrow live new york intention move back south rural kilronan 
 intentions change 
 see martha lives manipulation 
 used years past breed many championship horses 
now believes can use breed grandson 
though first helen finds martha charming soon caught domineering marthas web deception 
 hard understand nobody ever wises martha schemes 
 written characters film must slow witted 
 film even treats audience like idiots 
 tries get away things like leaving critical piece evidence rather unlikely place without even batting eye 
 audience accepts characters shallow isnt one thats likely question details 
jessica langes martha semideveloped character film applies talents redeem much can 
 character simply awful merely groanworthy 
gwyneth paltrow doesnt much build upon helens character trait seems daughterinlaw 
still fares better johnathon schaech whose character nonexistent hes inexplicably missing much film 
still much worse hell films 
even paperthin characters ludicrous setups hush manages create thrills colorbynumbers fashion 
 know whats coming occasionally film will deliver shock two 
 old formulas around reason doesnt mean taste fresh
