 turns line gives foreshadowing opening sequence rest movie well 
 latest jackie chan movies released america first runs hong kong chan plays international operative codenamed condor tasked united nations finding stash gold hidden secret base nazis retreat across saharan desert second world war

 arent supposed relatives nazi captain living spain condor finds granddaughter looking phone book something 
although two women supposed integral parts mission prove help except get trouble provide excuse chan jump martial arts 
 fact scenes ridiculously contrived seems everything just way set fight 
 suppose isnt bad since chans action really best part movie reason go see one films anyway 
 youve never seen jackie chan movie dont expect great plot expect entertained moves 
 well choreographed often amazing wonder guy human 
knowing stunts knowing real stuff computermasked bungee cords makes action sequences exciting 
youve got hand guy whos probably broken every bone body sake art 
also note jackie chan movie humor 
 far know none films take seriously even dramatic parts certain tongueincheek quality 
 almost masterful way humor even integrated fight scenes 
unlike martial arts film anything jean claude van damme fights get visceral level fight scenes chans movies simply entertaining 
 marvel moves way employs way make laugh 
unfortunately even chans mastery cant save film 
 plot characters weak dont hold movie together acting terrible 
carol cheng apparently won best actress honors hong kong movie awards past since operation condor dubbed movie kind takes bets 
 combined obviously low production value made want turn away screen heard kicks start flying
