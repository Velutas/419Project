 suppose im extremely surprised virus comes us deciple james cameron john bruno strain real hard even say obvious given particuarly looking standpoint mr camerons early works 
 fact virus yet another long line actionhorrorparanoia thrillers aliens vein group people dropped mysterious situation find mortallythreatening entity get textbook example hailing way back early talkies maybe even first pictures albeit redeveloped cameron blockbuster earned esteem bigger budgets come future 
 thing will happen bruno believe worked capacity quasilandmark feature bruno may studied camerons wing years years im beginning wonder capacity exactly learn 
 fact virus least mediocre fact bruno worked man like cameron director anything just knows make movie make film like virus just another detraction fairly aimed zgrade schlockfest film albeit zgrade schlockfest respectable budget 
 film seems borrow plot last years similarlyfated deep rising also clunkish bmovie s called leviathan underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando daniel stern group miners stumble upon alien lifeform part alien part john carpenters twisted remake thing 
 virus similar uh selling point group sailors boat stumble upon russian cruiser dead water 
 get 
 break pairs investigate 
 find alien lifeform board comes form energy taken machines board meshed machines parts corpses deemed humankind enemy misquote dictionary ha ha 
 second scary least bit involving film start chintzy bondian opening destruction cruiser via satellite transmission mir destroying suspense happen also fails bring us interesting chracters 
 motley crew choses potentially eccentric cast characters lead woman skipper masculine potentialromanticinterest drunken captain black technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor couple candidates alien food none least bit interesting dimensional thin plain piece writing paper 
 traditional argument films like may fact want eaten even aliens played karma arrogant soldiers plusside film whole opposite instead another cliche goes just dont give damn 
 almost dont even say acting everyone ranges subpar horrific former jamie lee curtis lead showing strong female lead just really latter pains say hes particular favorite mine donald sutherland plays captain poorly without second credibility will go performanceofwhichheshouldbeashamed 
like anthony hopkins legends fall line scrooooooo em thus embroidered upon membrance 
 peter otoole caligula 
great actor horrific performance 
 happens every now helps sutherlands career one except elite even bothered see film 
though sat shelves universal studios two years waiting can released make much money possibly can read early january everyones still trying catch potential oscarnominees show universal shelled pretty penny make film laden complex machinery boasts respectable production design may even feature believable special effects course anyone else see 
 virus mostly takes place large abandoned cruiser mostly night dawn mostly without use lights much productivity alien creatures pursuit human prey hollywood cliche seems go dark enough special effects will believable 
 dont believe go back rent godzilla tell theres even one shot see godzilla either entirety one wide shot b n light can least see well dont really sit just take word 
 doesnt matter since virus basically just one loud cluttered mess movie 
 action scenes muddled difficult follow action movie ive ever seen um favorite part scene trio end somehow outside ship five minute bouillabaisse tidal waves rain oceanextremeties film can cook end back ship one revealed apparently drowned well must say thanks telling afterwards sure couldnt figure saw 
imagine first attack aliens aliens shot pov soldiers authorities battle car hard follow done without dramatic intensity thats basically whole virus one horriblydirected action scene capping proposterous gadget saves day least couple original cast members 
 god long damn sit 
 interesting characters dramatic urgency tension one good moment action mesmerizing visuals wonder even got made 
 already know big movie studios mentality shallow best movies like sight saving private ryan give faith movies like virus manage drain little pool 
 almost wish instead making movie john bruno gone cinema verite captured meetings universal heads gave film green light 
 read script knew entrusting millions upon millions dollars director might well cameron hack still went ahead project bruno company shit back face 
even though hold universal contempt making horrible movie id say even contempt aimed mr bruno making movie bad 
 fact shouts egad man worked cameron anyway 
 justifiable encouraged
