 corruptor big silly mess action movie complete pointless plot turns gratuitous violence 
 abhorrent even blatantly unlikable doesnt make shred sense 
 whose idea director glengarry glen ross direct action film 
james foley knows lot characters acting strengths corruptor 
 quiet scenes clash ludicrous action nonsense result less like movie like derailed train 
 least chow yunfat lead role 
chow plays nick chen chinatown cop 
hes good cop first scenes establish hes familiar chinatown 
thats probably powersthatbe decide team rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg 
nick danny begin stepping others toes finally end liking get chance save ones life 
 happens kind mystery 
im fairly certain villains part fukienese dragons led young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann 
im also pretty sure nick payroll henry lee ric young gangster dealing prostitutes neat stuff 
im quite sure henry lee decides employ danny although makes ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along way 
theres also interesting subplot revolving around dannys father brian cox doesnt much main story 
one problems said movie doesnt make sense 
 dont blame entirely foley hes obviously good director 
im inclined point finger robert puccis script doesnt seem tune way normal people act 
one scene early particularly annoyed nick confronts boss hes angry new white partner 
hes shouting pointing finger stepping furniture thinking fired done 
 addition film takes bite racerelated issues never develops 
 lot scenes like one none coherent 
theres also considerable language barrier given chow actors thick chinese accents 
 plot never straightens 
im sure fukienese dragons henry lee associated group 
 corruptor action movie weird plot developments decorated loud violent action sequences 
 sequences arent bad theyre new many car chases chinatown seen 
 note many chinatown cop movies seen 
one many id imagine 
foleys strength clearly characterization pretty good job 
 scenes nick danny good actually got feel characters bond forms holds parts film together 
chow wahlberg good actors chow pro can kind stuff sleep 
wahlberg seems less home atmosphere hes still fun watch 
 also liked subplot involving dannys father brian coxs performance powerful character makes compelling moral compass danny 
 film ultimately fails mostly hands insane incoherence overlyfamiliar action scenes 
 complicated plot can successful story needs make sense 
 corruptor never manages make sense just keeps spinning control finally theres nothing left hold
