terrence malick made excellent minute film adaptation james jones world war ii novel 
unfortunately buried within overlong overreaching hour long pseudoepic 
 shame film features outstanding performance nick nolte 
 best scene nick noltes character lt col tall forced deal direct refusal capt staros elias koteas execute order 
noltes reaction transformation may best work career 
 terrence malick concentrated great performances nolte koteas well sean penn woody harrelson john cusack made truly great film 
instead malick saddled film plodding pacing unnecessary flashbacks voiceover narration designed telegraph great philosophical underpinnings story 
 narration especially annoying much sounded like bad high school poetry 
 lot editing core story transformed truly classic war film 
hopefully dvd version film will feature options suppress narration perhaps will even provide alternate shorter version film 
 give film
