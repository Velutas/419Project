 flubber second best example take life film remake adaptation hysterically enough distributed disney 
 kind film may slightly entertaining tiny kids anyone else will feel left boring slow incredibly lifeless 
 film cinematic magic instead dead water shame great film 
hypothetically mean 
 flubber probably know remake disney classic never saw absent minded professor well absent minded professor played fred mcmurray created erratic substance known flubber know flying rubber 
 new one keeps basic plot appears added lot else like absentmindedness part proffessor villains several showstopping moments like big rumba flubber elaborate setups none really make better instead make worse 
 basic plot revolves around college professor philip brainerd robin williams creates lots lots inventions sadly absent minded 
 fact hes forgotten wedding colleges president sara jean reynolds indie actress marcia gay harden two times forgets beginning 
doesnt warrant kind mental treatment 
anyway wedding day third one invents flubber bounces everything like super ball speed can also change shape like aliens water form abyss 
philip believes invention fully realized will save college threat shut millionaire tycoonvillain chester hoenicker raymond j barry ironically enough college brat son will wheaton thought dead goes 
 plot twist hoenickers goons named smith wesson ha ha great sense humor film played clancy brown ted levine needed pay check discover hard way try steal hoenicker wants just cause hes evil enough 
 subplot involves philips attempts win back sara whos angry good reason seduced basically philips belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald playing hysterically suaveyetunsuave asswhole 
 another subplot philips daytimer robot weebo voiced oneandonly jodi benson falls love 
yuckityyuck 
whats pathetic film dull 
 dont need cynical college student able see right film another long line cheap attempts making quick buck disney essentially become puff daddy film industry halfassedly remixing classics nonclassics distribution general public sadly eats 
earlier released jungle jungle adaptation really awful french film un indien dans la ville yeah improved original much 
disneys bad shape warner brothers right now creatively 
 rush ship film distribution disney forgotten give film little thing called magic 
 scenes dancing flubber flying car basketball team pretty much sucks flying around thanks carefully placed flubber elaborate ending fail amaze delight even cause people laugh 
 sat entire film stone faced chuckling perhaps twice shaking head bad jokes 
 really laugh scene philip enters wrong classroom starts teaching chemistry 
didnt think 
 doesnt help protagonist essentially unfunny even really respectable 
philip lovable absent minded professory just really dumb man played robin williams 
williams brilliant comic actor okay brilliant actor general hes given little occasionally get hyper something times act sad 
 times hes bad 
 supposed think man whos forgotten wedding thrice 
maybe funny andor respectable s 
 like disney usually enjoy films animated live action recent films save hercules good great worse lackluster theyve pathetic 
 jungle jungle probably worst film saw last year 
 flubber s probably second 
 need 
perhaps create something new 
get writers can write something thats universally entertaining 
films like parent trap mary poppins films live action latter case mix even can still watch theyre written magical children fun adults 
whats torturous taking child film insults annoys every turn 
 god couldnt done something else edie mcclurg
