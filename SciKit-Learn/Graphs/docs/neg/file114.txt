one contributors destruction batman film franchise chris odonnell stars remake buster keatons silent film seven chances 
now ive never seen seven chances im chaplin fan keaton fan seriously doubt classic version insipid 
odonnell plays jimmie shannon manager pool table manufacturing company 
 also fears commitment despite dating anne renee zellweger three years hes unwilling marry 
 reasons 
well hes guy see well guys like stallions apparently dont like roped something hey thats movies explanation 
id marry renee zellweger second 
eventually comes time jimmie propose absurd proposal ever uttered man ever 
 essentially says win hands ring 
 audience now hate character 
 
 meat plot presents 
jimmies grandfather peter ustinov completely wasted dies leaves jimmie entire estate million dollars well ownership pool table business 
however order get money save jobs factory workers jimmie must married next birthday just hours away 
 blown chances anne jimmie proceeds track prior girlfriends suggest business proposition 
 movie wasnt half bad time surprisingly 
 wasnt boring even managed read thoughts one point 
ustinovs character left video will hes reading ridiculous clause thought brewsters millions 
 soon thought hal holbrooks character actually says brewsters millions 
 quite surreal 
something happens though films final act caused sharply drop rating going receive 
 point jimmies prior girlfriends turned business proposition felt good 
 least film wasnt painting women cold hearted gold diggers 
 jimmie options goofy friend played artie lange making career playing goofy friend places ad newspaper somehow becomes front page story 
 point women don wedding gowns head persuade jimmie pick bride 
 women arrive jimmies location immediately start bullying hes looking woman 
 hes enough unjustified attacks tells angry mob theres mistake wont marrying 
 result women proceed chase around city hopes catching tearing limbs
