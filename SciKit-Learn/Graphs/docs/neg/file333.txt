 rule comes movies 
 sequel never good original 
 exceptions rule texas chainsaw massacre next generation one 
now also take consideration original chainsaw massacre really bad movie isnt even first sequel recipe painful viewing experience 
dont fooled presence coming talents matthew mcconaughey time kill renee zellweger jerry maguire 
 made movie stars 
judging performances also made took acting lessons 
 wonder ever worked hollywood appearing turkey 
apparently producers film realized just bad sat unreleased years someone decided might able capitalize success mcconaughey zellweger 
apparently two young stars none happy thing ever seeing light day 
 dont blame better sort porno flick starring two 
unfortunately horror film zellweger plays typically stupid horror film character 
 mcconaughey plays guy wears mechanical brace leg controls television remote control 
 hey dont say didnt warn 
 make matters worse leatherface chainsaw wielding maniac never scariest psychopathic killers best times now become full blown crossdresser spends entire movie drag 
 plot movie isnt worth mentioning 
lets just suffice say group teenagers typical wrong place wrong time left mercy remote control man mcconaughey lipstick wearing chainsaw revving halfwitted sidekick 
man cant get just bad movie 
 film absolutely redeeming qualities 
even obligatory topless babe shot wasnt enough hold interest seconds 
 writing bad direction even worse things look good comparison acting 
 sort movie make people prison watch 
 guarantee criminals thought subjected film never break law
