well going expect 
 movie big snake eats people 
thats thinking viewed film maybe enjoyed 
instead ended wishing giant snake come along eat 
anaconda documentary film crew sailing south american river 
led anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz terri flores jennifer lopez crew attempting locate lost tribe natives 
along way find poacher paul sarone jon voight become unwillingly embroiled quest capture elusive anaconda 
 simply say worlds largest snake wouldnt justice since anaconda movie least two feet wide 
 isnt good reason avoid picking hitchhikers dont know 
 beginning anaconda find flores cale kind relationship past seems less now 
 expected fact play key part somewhere line ended setup nothing 
cale chokes deadly wasp dont ask happens dont know put action relegated person rest film crew must get back civilization medical help 
 minimally helps add sense urgency plot since goal now comes direct conflict sarones plan capture snake 
however negated fact cale seems get better halfway film event still results zero payoff relationship angle 
 bad characters either annoying stupid 
 movie theyre 
since description applies characters except sarone hard find someone root 
youre supposed back good guys really end cheering sarone hes smarter everyone else 
 maybe hes just dumb everyone else 
 times almost found rooting snake 
 standout performances 
everyone seems reciting lines written stock characters 
even voight appears best impression christopher walken reason 
 matter monster movies snake supposed real star anyway 
 scenes snake computer generated effects crew decent job making look real 
however realism thrown pretty unrealistic occurrences 
sometimes example snake just moves fast 
 catches guy jumping waterfall crying loud 
 theres another scene snake eats one characters see snakes skin drawn tightly prey can see victims pained expression within snakes belly 
absolutely ridiculous 
 testimony films bad direction inclusion scene early film get see just dangerous mighty anaconda 
 scene totally unrelated anything else witness big snake winning showdown panther 
 anaconda wraps around powerful feline stuffed animal squeezes hard one panthers eyeballs pops 
eeeewwwww 
 beyond sick factor however scene surprised actually showed face snake quarter movie even passed 
 films like sense mystery surrounding monster must maintained 
 characters reacting something fear see audience must experience feeling along 
 show us monster early let us something characters dont know therefore allow us get used danger pivotal moment man beast climactic showdown 
 case like showdown just ends letdown 
 saw snake first time decided give film benefit doubt assume snake saw wasnt real danger 
 one just decoy actually bigger snake waiting make appearance just everyone thought safe 
 luck 
okay maybe anaconda actually decoy theres really better movie waiting make debut
