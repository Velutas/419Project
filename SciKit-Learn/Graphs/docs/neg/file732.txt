 paraphrase michelle pfieffers character dangerous minds say beyond rangoon starts 
thats fair enough 
 movies like school children given benefit doubt 
 chance succeed 
 like think right combination talent effort can wonders 
mountains can moved good movies can made 
yeah right 
children fail films 
 director john boormans latest 
 success beyond rangoon hinges believability patricia arquette ed wood true romance busty westernerinperil wandering burma without passport 
though can stomach mild plot contrivances get tougher task overlook actress 
shes lightweight 
 first scene narration 
demonstrates doesnt nearly enough range emotions charactera mother fleeing memories murdered husband sonis supposed show 
 may give stronger performance say keanu reeves walk clouds much 
beyond rangoon physically appealing film thanks practiced craftsmanship john boorman deliverance excalibur hope glory 
 keeps narrative moving matter muddy storyor heroinegets 
 chose arquette remains mystery though 
maybe thinking dramatic weight story overcome casting deficiencies 
 even hour halfstated political statements murky mass killings still dont know enough whats happening country feel distressed characters situations 
empty exoticism 
 technical credits beyond rangoon curious mix combining lush jungle photography bad bluescreen work 
also odd obvious dubbing 
done make foreign characters sound less foreign 
 mistake extras keep reappearing different soldiers
