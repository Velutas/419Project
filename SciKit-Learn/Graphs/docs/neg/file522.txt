saw advanced screening movie sniper last night say wasnt impressed 
 film expert marine sniper played tom berenger teamed hotshotyoungnoexperienceneverkilledaman new partner take drugkingpins military strong men panama 
sound cliche 
thats beginning 
billy zane memphis belle played rookie never seemed get handle character 
 contrary pigheaded beginning just wanted smack 
 goes crazy pressure seems immediately snap 
im sure blame lie directing editing scriptwriting acting 
 didnt come together 
 think berenger pretty good actor looked great part covered camo face painted stalking jungle highpower rifle 
 character given pretty bad dialogue didnt react logically many situations 
 little logical development characters 
 biggest problem film tendency put two snipers many inchesfromdeath situations possible 
 began resemble g joes greatest american hero 
 course almost supernatural accuracy guns called upon get far many close calls 
now lot movies stamped mold fact thats made die hard much fun superhero avenger type 
 will enjoy action hero heroics didnt think fit nice tension built earlier scenes real life feel covert operations panama 
 word must said camera work much nice 
 jungles panama standins case formed picturesque background 
 drama speeding bullets captured using nice trick photography 
many seen slowed bulletcam following projectile target 
 used well beginning show feverish nightmares berenger gets remembering moment kill 
 dramatic used flashback 
 seems director liked technique much started inserting shots pardon pun real time action 
 just seemed silly 
 real dog nice action good atmosphere pretty photography 
 plot pretty lame acting didnt form cohesive whole far much thisclosefromdeath heroics
