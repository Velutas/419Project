comments watchers reborn cheaply made directtovideo turkey fourth sequel first film version dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers 
technically called watchers v seems cycle horror movies much like many sequelcrazy film series decided drop numbers titles 
 even star trek movies dropped numbers titles star trek vi 
 makers watchers reborn probably want fool unsuspecting video rental customers thinking might good movie instead crappy fifth installment film series died long time ago 
 really isnt good movie 
 ever rented movie recieved sinking feeling watched previews preceding feature presentation 
well hope viewer may perhaps fan novelist dean koontz actor mark hamill will dashed time hes seen trailers tagged beginning watchers reborn 
theyre awful 
 commercials cover films like strange stripper movie called shadow dancer weird crap dead indian teens wolves action movie called detonator starring scott baio 
scott baio 
 idiot dreamed movie 
 surviving abysmal trailers person finally gets watch movie rented watchers reborn 
 maybe wont bad may say 
 perhaps just perhaps bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised greatly misleading 
watchers reborn based cool book dean koontz wrote decade ago 
 stars mark hamill luke skywalker terrific star wars trilogy 
lou rawls even mix 
unfortunately force certainly longer mark hamill looks sick movie shares basic plot elements watchers book 
 latter really bad 
koontz hack writer producing way many thrillers good still favorite hack writer 
koontz writing style succinct suspenseful 
people read many books however often complain repetitive plot devices 
 definately koontz book isnt psychic superintelligent dog psychotic killer likes ripping peoples eyeballs 
watchers three devices may explain arguably popular koontzs books 
 idea behind koontzs novel though highly implausible interesting 
basically biological war machine created smart dog can released battle track target relay targets position psychically large creature designed kill handtohand combat 
silly kind neat 
im sorry 
 dont mean ramble matters directly linked watchers reborn movie 
 suppose just dont want talk movie 
 turkey really cheesy 
 one movie can act including mark hamill difficult seeing aged luke skywalker stumble around trying hero 
 cheese factor increased hes involved implied sex scene blond biologist geneticist zoologist whateverthef kshessupposedtobe befriends 
mercifully filmmakers opted nudity 
 honest halfconvincing actor film golden retriever plays einstein 
 know movie bad dog outacts human counterparts 
 find difficult relate laughable action sequences movie 
 creature 
yes creature poor einstein guy furry suit mask poorly imitates werewolves howling 
 creature shot times okay 
 creature ability kill people swinging arms around pushing 
oh can also rip body parts allowing many scenes fake hands arms thrown around 
cheesy gore 
thats another main element watchers reborn 
 many bloody scenes thoroughly unconvincing increase films campiness rather suspense 
ultimately gave watchers reborn star half bad horror scifi film buffs may get kicks films silliness though film will tax even patience minute film feels like four hours 
also hate admit survived far worse 
anyone sat christopher lambert natasha henstridge debacle known adrenalin fear rush will know mean 
finally couldnt help think watchers reborn work well bot fodder creative folks behind one alltime favorite shows mystery science theater 
 thought alone helped survive watchers reborn smile face 
rated r watchers reborn contains dozens bloodspattered bodies unconvincing gore 
 also violence obviously 
 wouldnt recommend little kids im sure even young teens make movie okay 
instead watching film however recommend reading koontzs book 
trust itll time much much better spent
