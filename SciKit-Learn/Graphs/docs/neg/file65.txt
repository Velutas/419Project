running time minutes 
directed christian duguay 
ive never fully understood wesley snipess career 
 ups downs mostly downs 
 best movie one best movie entitled blade 
 typical action movies boiling point passenger new movie art war just called rising sun art war cause basically semiremake plot different cast forced ridiculously unbelievable thriller high style low substance 
wesley snipes plays james bondish type secret agent working u n chinese ambassador killed track killer trying find happened killer 
anne archer plays boss type person u n hired snipes track killer 
well snipes mistakenly framed killer now outlaw kidnapping chinese woman help along way 
 leads finale dumb stupid unbelievably dumb stunts dialogue acting ruin movie 
wesley snipes isnt one favorite actors fact character plays every movie character plays movie 
 good role snipes really s blade 
 walked art war expecting good high octane thriller got pile mush 
 real good thing movie action plenty noticed badly filmed camera shaky even tell going 
 ending finale worthless pitiful even tries mock matrix laughably funny undeniably stupid 
christian duguays direction also great 
 camera angles sense style place sadly lighting editing badly done 
even whole matrix ending wasnt even good 
 stunts action badly filmed badly choreographed 
 placing characters assination chinese ambassador plotting movie predictable laughable just takes fun entire movie 
anne archer usually good roles turns horrible job 
 sour downbeat dreadfully dull forced dialogue dumb moves 
even donald sutherland costar cant save movie bust 
 overall opinion art war total waste time 
 entertaining exciting even action packed 
 pointless movie makes absolutely sense 
 really want see good version art war rent wesley snipes sean connery action vehicle kind rising sun isnt great film either least better
