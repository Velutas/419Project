borrowing ideas films robinson crusoe mars quatermass pit space odyssey even mario bavas planet vampires terrore nello spazio mission mars hodgepodge ideas dont add satisfying whole 
 sequences wonderfully handled executed film remains flat uninvolving 
 much time giving establishing lead characters film good use 
 performances workmen like don cheadle luc carrying sort real chemistry 
gary sinise wasted role requires look experiencing sleep depravation 
 mistaken idea jerry oconnell phil ohlmyer play part comic relief just painful excuse 
 less said tim robbins called home performance better 
hes just much fun give damn 
 script lapses namely discovering several breaches hull ship caused meteorite shower one thinks checking fuel tanks remainder ship damage 
 course leads heroes abandon rescue ship 
also one character sacrifices character takes religious demeanor completely odds situation 
 biggest offence film horrid intrusive score ennio morricone 
subtlety nonexistent 
 fact scenes music becomes extravagant dialogue almost drowned 
 sequence score almost works protracted meteorite shower 
 pacing film leisurely 
 opening introduction characters lasts full minutes finally dropped onto martian surface 
 another long pause plot character development including elaborate dance sequence zero gravity 
 film lose minutes actually gain momentum 
 many scenes talking heads discussing already know going happen drags film dead stop 
 good news film absolutely sumptuous look 
 vistas planet mars majestic awe inspiring 
 design numerous spacecraft suits expertly drafted level realism hasnt seen since space odyssey 
 visual effects just stunning space walk sequences visualization evolution earth 
 fault come martians look like something plastic model kit something another world 
director de palma stages wonderfully creative scenes film 
 opening sequence alone seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost minutes homage hitchcocks rope introduced characters 
scenes rescue ship rotating centrifuge just amazing execution 
 nagging question final explanation worth sturm und drang 
sadly 
director brian de palma crafted extravagant production 
 set design visual effects arresting 
 comic strip denouncement ruin might fine return good adventurous thought provoking science fiction 
 disappointing film one might still entertain can settle visuals
