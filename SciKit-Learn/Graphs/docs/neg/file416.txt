 hours since returned much anticipated scifi opus mission mars can still detect reek moldy cheddar 
 
 movie shoddy cheesefest full digital eye candy stapled carelessly onto flimsy screenplay somehow manages leapfrog great promise space opera instead shooting angle feelgood science fiction drama akin space odyssey 
 got feeling fellow moviegoing patrons expecting another armageddon 
 mission mars certainly isnt one large action sequence colossal disaster 
 supposedly thoughtful familyfriendly space flick apocalyptic excitement takes back seat visual elegance uplifting drivel 
 warned 
 course crafting tightly claustrophobic space drama impossible see apollo excellent example directors possess skill craftsmanship pull without seriously scarring reputation 
brian de palma enough directorial expertise visual wizardry sleeve pull 
 gets hands intelligent systematically practical script like untouchables mission impossible director ability create sound technical achievement although overly indulgent style becomes bothersome occasionally 
 course theres also inexcusable string crap carried name including snake eyes notorious bomb bonfire vanities 
 makes want call de palma talented hack hollywood 
 term may harsh judging solely perpetual waste talent mission mars choice words slightly less lenient 
 gary sinise wouldnt touch de palma foot pole 
sinise wonderful wonderful actor appearing snake eyes vomitinducing sham im sure wouldnt want risk embarrassment third collaboration 
 academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell man recently lost wife kim delaney apparently psychologically unfit upcoming space shuttle mission mars oops forgot mention year 
 barbecue gettogether astronauts cut luc goddard don cheadle team already taking measurements calculations red planet 
suddenly towering formation rocks soil probably best dubbed sand tornado appears creates whirlwind suction 
 reason astronauts just stand calmly admire lovely piece art 
 team killed within seconds expect luc able send one final transmission may still alive 
immediately second mission consisting astronauts mcconnell husband wife woody terri blake tim robbins connie nielsen phil ohlmyer jerry oconnell dispatched rescue luc discover mysterious secret planet mars 
lets put secret hold now discuss trip 
 explained whether scientifically accurate probably trip mars takes roughly six months 
im sure quartet screenwriters behind mm didnt capitalize juicy opportunity creating tension claustrophobia 
instead join team final days aboard ship 
 happened five months prior 
 just play cards tell dirty jokes 
still nicely tense moments maybe movie timeframe involving fuel leak 
depalmas direction quite good scenes although score ennio morricone largely inconsistent organ music space 
cmon 
theres good imaginative ideas landslide cheese sad realization causes sigh loud 
 colossal bummer mission mars poorly assembled laughably written dubious supremely silly finale will satisfy dedicated optimists 
 mentioned anyone looking disastermovie carnage going feel savagely disappointed 
maybe even cheated 
 unbelievably hokey final shot words end somehow adding insult injury audience members made effort boo hiss screen 
others muttered obscenities shaking heads disbelief mumbling jeez sucked 
okay suck 
 show actors sympathetic mercy 
 pretty well 
sinise sincere effective many scenes robbins nielsen wholeheartedly convince loving nasa couple funnyman oconnell well couple lines actually amusing intentionally 
 digital effects accompanying sand tornado sequence quite impressive 
 golly mission go wrong 
looking back appalling experience say practically every conduit crevasse 
 watching mission mars suggestion immediately abort better yet dont even strap liftoff
