 haunting arrived theaters kept hearing overdone special effects fact often unseen bumps night horror film far scarier can put face courtesy special effects 
 agree remake haunting goes bit overboard visual effects department dont think completely blame movies failure 
 appears people failed take account original haunting unseen terrors scary dust bunny 
 special effects story isnt least bit scary arent going end frightening movie 
 thing interested movie caretaker building played bruce dern 
dern always great even though may minutes screen time still interesting element movie 
 sat seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects kept wishing movie derns caretaker one dimensional characters populated cast 
never good sign bit player best part movie 
liam neeson plays scientist conducting experiments fear 
 decides best way get results trick group fairly unstable individuals spend days haunted mansion 
 tricks participating letting conducting experiment insomnia 
 also fails mention mansion reputation strange goingson 
catherine zetajones lili taylor owen wilson play subjects 
like original taylors character star movie 
 since doesnt quite marquee power liam neeson ms zetajones parts seem big larger original 
 lets face probably half people see movie will zetajones 
ill admit never seen thing werent 
 real stars special effects combined fairly overdone sets 
 take movie supernatural elements house start interact hapless insomnia patients 
 really isnt much story 
just endless setups director jan de bont can showcase nifty special effects got play 
 special effects great 
 many cases good likely see anywhere 
 cases overdone obviously thrown just sake hitting cool shots quota 
 point movie things ever come close scary funny maybe 
 scary 
 set 
 first saw house impressed cool gothic look 
 took short tour characters around place see set designers obviously much money burn visual effects people decided take idiotically overdone route 
 included flooded hallway books stepping stones mirrored circular room revolves 
 part rooms play story 
absolutely none 
 just take minds fact neither descent story single scare entire movie 
 actors 
lili taylor never one favorites 
 fact character mousy pathetic factored comes around average slightly mark 
 idea liam neeson took role 
 basically reminded ringmaster control circus 
 character charge farce quickly got away 
 doubt liam will want lock prints movie secure vault along copies darkman 
zetajones cast hot words 
 fact character bisexual just icing cake 
 catherine movie look good 
fortunately something well 
 fairly good size part obvious purpose movie eyecandy 
 bad someone talents wasted 
 random supermodel pulled fashion show easily filled role 
 haunting antithesis another s horror movies blair witch project 
 haunting seemingly limitless effects budget blair witch relies piles rocks scares 
 prove quite nicely special effects irrelevant horror film 
 story sucks downhill 
 advice 
 looking special effects go rent star wars 
 scares want rent halloween 
either way probably best interests skip haunting
