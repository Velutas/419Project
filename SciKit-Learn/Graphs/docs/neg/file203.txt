jessica lange one inconsistent actresses working today 
 timetotime blows away audiences powerful intense performances 
 hand woman made jawdroppingly awful feature debut dino delaurentiis king kong 
 much lange probably prefer moviegoers develop amnesia regarding particular entry resume every work reminiscent quality 
hush one example 
lange bad might fun watch rest film wasnt prime example motion picture tedium 
 film opens many socalled psychological thrillers posing light drama 
 introduced jackson johnathon schaech last encounter tom hanks thing helen gwyneth paltrow picture perfect young couple much love 
jackson taking helen home holidays can meet mother martha lange 
 moment first saw martha started looking fangs 
soon wicked witch east plotting way son get helen pregnant involves poking hole diaphragm 
 goal accomplished manipulates events expecting couple moves new york city horse farm lives 
 long gets way martha perfectly amicable person helen defies declaration war 
hush three simple problems incredibly dumb incredibly boring incredibly predictable least stupefying ending 
 film absolutely nothing recommend exception couple nice shots snowcovered fields quick glimpse gwyneth paltrows bare buttocks 
frankly embarrassing watch respected actress langes stature give performance like like bad blanche dubois role played tv version streetcar named desire 
meanwhile paltrow best get dialogue without gaping stupidity lines schaech attempts passable imitation inanimate object 
 psychological thrillers battle lines clearly drawn 
 mom wife jackson caught middle 
 course since schaechs character poorlydeveloped badly acted impossible say feels situation 
maybe someone ask hes familiar oedipus 
martha course evil one 
 know shes evil 
 smokes cigarettes drinks hard liquor two sure signs devil work 
 hand helen good girl 
 evidence shes nice old ladies treasures locket picture dead parents 
thats character development 
beyond point hush just series increasingly hardtoswallow coincidences contrivances moronic plot twists 
however first minutes just warmup ending anticlimactic profoundly dissatisfying 
 cant imagine anyone matter thought movie whole liking conclusion 
either serious lastminute editing someone left pages script 
 climax disliked hush time end credits started hated 
viewers invest something every movie watch matter good bad 
cheating like offensive unpardonable 
 entries wornout wormeaten genre arent especially good 
films like consenting adults hand rocks cradle single white female rely stock plots predictable twists propel narrative along 
 general however theyre directed degree competence assures level sustained tension 
thats case really bad thrillers like fail generate even momentary heart palpitation characters bland plot uninvolving anyone audience care 
indeed title movie probably refers producers hope viewers will lieu telling friends really think sorry piece celluloid
