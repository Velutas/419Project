years ago robin williams made jumanji brilliant achievement special effects travesty nearly every level 
 can said dreams may come boring illogical weepiewannabe left senses numb 
dont get wrong love breathtaking special effects pulsepounding imagery 
brazil personal top ten 
 city lost children great film outlandish scenarios 
 even love last year marienbad minority amidst friends 
 dreams may come imagery aside little daring thought complement imagery 
 daring thought never fully realized 
 idea plot lukewarm insults bigger questions raises 
 better filmmakers rid film live action sequences put electronica soundtrack sell one popular minds eye videos 
robin williams plays chris nielsen dies prematurelynot story chance really know care 
 director vincent ward screenwriter ronald bass chosen tell life story flashbacks foreground story focus experience afterlife 
big mistake 
 far better take halfhour needed tell life story first ala wonderful life can build respect know possibly care children longsuffering wife played superbly annabella sciorra 
instead filmmakers insult intelligence rushing story expecting film grow depth progresses 
 doesnt 
 afterlife chris learns people still dont meet god b thoughts reality c time exist 
hmm 
ill grant one silly giant ideas sake narrative 
 meeting god part still irks perhaps possible way film give due respect 
 said alternate reality still makes possible sense 
read 
chris wife commits suicide 
since suicides go hell chris separated wife forever 
 important question heaven really heaven separated one love 
good question 
 like good thoughtprovoking questions 
 dont like filmmakers deviate question 
 loathe filmmakers deviate question film becomes popular rescue film especially rescue film take underlying premise seriously 
 really loathe story longer run logic special effects 
hey chris forget 
 thoughts real 
 real physical world according newage screenplay 
 dont conjure positive thoughts annie let run wild 
 appear two live happy bliss eternity 
 movie thats 
 albert angel played miscast cuba gooding jr says bluntly thats fantasy 
umm 
 thoughts real physical fantasy fantasy real 
surely eastern meditation specialist able tell 
 happen think unimaginative person thoughts arent big enough sustain eternity well due respect thats dont subscribe theology 
 due respect 
another idea based time pause exist 
 chris spend eternity annie earth reliving favorite memories hang growing 
youve got eternity perhaps can hang around long enough learn freak 
 forcing write still exist diary imo just tacky 
 many ideas hundred times better whats unraveled plot 
 great aforementioned question sidetracked gimmicky subplots done just come stale 
 insulting subplot important people chris life appear heaven differently expects finally show realizes along 
 happens film runs slow motion build emotion 
gag spoon 
 things like sciorras effective performance rises far mundane material special effects 
please note enjoyed visuals enjoy images looked like sandy duncan universe everybody floating invisible strings 
 sounds like joke really true really tried block dialogue figure music best work alternative soundtrack 
 vote goes rare cd called never say die petra christian rock group 
 pretty good song annie commits suicide 
 late annieshes gone away goodtheres much wed told herand now wish couldbut late 
melancholic yes 
depressing yes 
 far entertaining 
 case dont know let straight
