 know something christmas presents 
 overhyped holiday films lots merchandising product tieins 
 least seem message grinch advertised since last christmas whose logo currently plastered stores 
hollywood expects us ignore cynical greed movie scolds us losing true spirit season 
 know plot theres evil furry green guy called grinch jim carrey lives mountain overlooking whoville 
 whos preparing whobilation grinch determined steal christmas 
 movie course liveaction version beloved childrens book previously adapted tv special looney tunes animator chuck jones 
 rare big budget hollywood release shamed thirtyyearold halfhour cartoon thats case jones version compared ron howards 
 tv grinch hit right notes boris karloffs soft deep narration thurl ravenscroft singing mr grinch max dog weighed gigantic antler tied head grinchs wide toothless grin 
 contrast movie hits one sour note another 
first numerous bad choices jeffrey price peter seaman made padding short book minute movie 
young wideeyed cindy lou taylor momsen depressed misplaced priorities parents bill irwin molly shannon holiday season 
 begins sympathize grinch turns surprisingly sympathetic 
cindy lou discovers grinch turned tearfully away whoville grammar school publicly humiliated expressing love prettiest girl class martha may whovier played adult christine baranski 
 expected like grinch hate whos want steal christmas 
 grinch isnt even villain role filled corrupt mayor whoville jeffrey tambor grinchs rival marthas affection 
 characters needlessly complex oncesimple plot becomes convoluted actual theft christmas seems like afterthought 
 casting choices arent better screenwriting decisions 
jim carrey seems woefully miscast 
 face supple rubber makeup seems superfluous carrey brings nothing else role 
 accent keeps changing assume shooting karloff ends sounding like weird slurry richard nixon sean connery cartman south park 
 knowing else many scenes alone grinchs home carrey falls back standup comedy clowns around ace venturastyle 
needless say wisecracking antics dont quite fit character grinch embittered loner filled hate 
little taylor momsen brings little role cindy lou except big eyes cute smile 
 fine cindy lou limited original purpose seuss story finding santa living room stealing tree 
however expanded script makes cindy important grinch momsen challenge 
bottom line youre stealing christmas movies leave one behind
