 little remakes updates older films tv series 
 theres will theres way believe anything matter great revered can effectively improved upon 
 reason responded well gus van sants universally panned update psycho thought intriguing cinematic experience also onpar original 
 big problem remakes blatantly bad 
 see point remake least iron originals flaws bring work much closer greatness even perfection 
 source material remake based isnt good begin 
 cinematic question pondered bland actioner mod squad 
ive seen couple episodes late s tv series based honest didnt like much 
 concept still interesting group corrupt young adults early s given choice either go jail various crimes committed can become undercover cops helping police get places normally wouldnt able access 
obviously opt latter option become undercover policemen policewomen 
 three main characters played claire danes omar epps giovanni ribisi 
 three danes real character 
ribisis dumbass year old played exclusively laughs epps slightly intelligent one used create various chase scenes 
 squads superviser gets killed reputation dirtied death three sure beloved master framed go investigate discovering corrupt cops lots lots expensive whores lucrative drug operations 
 kinds good stuff 
 times mod squad comes even close working comedic moments 
although ribisi trite actor characters repeat movie movie man really rather amusing script gives chance 
epps straight man effectively played ribisis clueless spontaneity 
 rest film dull boring singularly uninteresting 
 drugop action plot longer anything new even teenage action heroes way executed also nowhere near exciting suspenseful 
claire danes character potential buried heaps cliches performance restrained 
 tourdeforce instead director scott silver puts shackles simply allow anything really significant role 
epps ribisi fare slightly better well can expected although characters arent nearly rich danes 
 mod squad mindnumbing marketing plot film teens will jump 
 full bad dialogue scenes concepts make sense get drug dealers like tango guys spare time 
nothing remotely intriguing worth paying 
claire danes longer alluring mainly shes got horrible hairdo draw 
 however cool explosions guns chases may lure viewer thinking experience exciting thriller sort 
 fooled 
 may call escapist fare call escapeasquicklyasyoucan fare
