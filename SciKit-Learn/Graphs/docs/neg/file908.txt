 noble attempt shake things unfortunately just doesnt work 
part fun watching sparring romantic comedy comes recognizing chemistry even characters speechless already know theyre attracted left waiting campaign end theyll admit love already 
 herkyjerky feel constant bickering making even kings sharp dialogue cant prevent speechless becoming repetitive half hour 
inconsistency also defining characteristic performances geena davis michael keaton performances scenes together 
 problems begin initial courtship virtually nothing establish julias character merely establishes kevin wiseass 
davis radiantly beautiful keaton generally entertaining characters plastic nothing happens seems matter one bit
