 sad irony screened fright night part day one stars roddy mcdowall passed away age 
mcdowall one talented prolific actors hollywood career spanned years appearing films 
fright night part probably will counted among memorable roles 
 really sad considering good first fright night film 
william ragsdale roddy mcdowall reprised roles somewhat reluctant vampire killers seem ones realize vampires walk among us 
 least movies anyway 
 several years since charlie brewster ragsdale bmovie actor turned late night horror film host peter vincent mcdowall came face face real live vampire just happened charlies next door neighbor 
charlie peter won battle apparently even vampires relatives get pissed kill members family 
apparently charlies former bloodsucking next door neighbor sister none pleased find kid aging actor staked sibling 
 decides exact little bit revenge 
 ends forcing charlie peter battle forces darkness yet 
one things made fright night success chris sarandon played charlies stylish next door neighbor taste blood 
fright night part tries duplicate modern style falls sort 
 stylish vamps film just dont personality undead first film 
 exception werewolf adds much needed comic relief scenes 
one bright spot speaking strictly sexist point view traci lin plays charlies skeptical girlfriend 
 really shame career hasnt better since made film 
ragsdale fair job film doesnt give nearly performance original 
roddy mcdowall makes given unfortunately isnt much shame character lot fun original movie 
 guess say first film superior product every way 
 original always left feeling danger lurking right around corner part feel music video 
never good thing horror film 
another minus part traditional scenes leave audience edge seats waiting something jump shadow rare 
 matter almost nonexistent 
 going watch horror film far first choice 
 first fright night hand right near top list 
 mood roddy mcdowall film id probably head science fiction section local video store rent planet apes 
either way fright night part likely enter equation
