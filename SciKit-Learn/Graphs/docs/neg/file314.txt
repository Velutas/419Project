let begin saying easily worst movie entire official even unofficial james bond series 
 full selfparody silly characters almost believe watching spoof 
 omen come provided precredits sequence dull affair featuring confrontation man difficult give better description since mention made elsewhere movie assassin title 
 song woefully terrible lyrics follows rest movie even worse 
 plot might pleasant change usual ruletheworld often found james bond movies s get confused mismash fabled assassin francisco scaramanga christopher lee putting performance one rare saving graces movie someone apparently payed one million dollars order remove roger moores 
 also flimsy connection energy crisis missing solar cell efficiency 
 much mess sounds 
bond helped task mary goodnight ekland whose character couldnt possibly closer stereotypical bimbo 
 course movie gets locked closet car trunk blunders around control room accidentally setting laser serves purpose enhancing plot whatsoever 
maud adams later star octopussy much stronger useful character hardly features movie 
scaramangas lackey dwarf called niknak rather fittingly also possibly silliest henchman series serving annoyance weak dialogue equal measures 
worse still almost total lack action throughout whole movie 
 one fight sequence fifteen minutes counting ludicrous scene two teenage girls beat several dozen trained martial artists another misguided attempt humour 
 solitary car chase might highlight action interrupted frequent basis redneck sheriff j w 
pepper played clifton james live let die fame yelling stupid comments passenger window 
 easily irritating character james bond movie 
even presence made bearable one impressive car stunts cinematic history degree twisting loop jump broken bridge except somebody got idea dub mocking whistle tone final print 
 top debacle whole end film anticlimatic sequence scaramangas funhouse 
 good thing came movie producers make next film series infinitely superior spy loved great film order bond franchise survive
