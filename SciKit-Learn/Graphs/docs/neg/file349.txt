 happy bastards quick movie review 
wild wild west 
 better name movie mightve wild wild waste 
warner bros attempt get men black style movie managed lasso big names actor will smith director barry sonnenfeld duo behind mibs success order get fourth july blockbuster contemporary bigscreen update classic westernscifi series wild wild west starring robert conrad 
 somehow ran problem along way 
 busy trying fill specific roles forgot one general wouldve made difference story writer 
wild wild wests story script compiled six different people rather just one put brilliant touches men black ed solomon 
 warner bros gotten movie wouldve possibly five times better 
heck ten times 
 however story screenplay mess filled dead laughs enough racist sex jokes make even will cringe hes performing complete lack chemistry made tv show work well 
heres story us army member james west will smith teams creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline take ruthless villain name arliss loveless kenneth branagh whose lower half blown civil war leaving roll around steamcontrolled wheelchair 
 catch onto plot involving superweapon can basically considered foot tarantula although looks bigger hellbent destroying anything path 
 said way script unfolds complete mess 
 acting doesnt help either 
kevin kline miserable gordon failing display even smidgeon care western silverado 
smith seems better time west although hes nearly charming mib 
branagh goes excessively top villain perhaps point cant even stand look strange beard 
 salma hayek along ride search missing father mostly exists just sexual attention 
 acting barely passable breath fresh ass 
director barry sonnenfeld isnt great help either 
even though shows good creativity points overall urgency directing lost 
 feels hes directing tv movie big nono youre helming whats supposed bigscreen hit 
last least huge gaps logic just plain unacceptable 
 one point smith defies gravity first boarding klines train 
 jumps back gets launched straight air somehow manages land three cars ahead train still motion 
also seems strangely comfortable talking racism front lynch mob particularly considering fact family killed likes folks 
last least still making kissing faces knows hes kissing woman hes looking peephole enemy 
 saving grace wild wild west come mostly form special effects 
 huge mechanical spider technical marvel authentic looking considerable creativity show 
theres also good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces spinning saw blades logic question comes play regarding polarity 
 say sit back good time wild wild west really isnt possible 
 racist sex jokes dont bother performances will 
 performances dont bother story will 
 story doesnt bother racist sex jokes will 
theres end vicious circle 
go rent men black instead pretend smith tommy lee jones wearing cowboy hats 
youll better time 
 go keep eye robert conrad role president grant 
 bet wishes somewhere else
