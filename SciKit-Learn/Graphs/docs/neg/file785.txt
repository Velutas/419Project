 varsity blues best film thus far 
unfortunately also first film seen 
 another one smalltown sports movies involves flawed goodheartedfrom 
 another one smalltown sports movies involves flawed goodhearted protagonist rough meanspirited coach big game 
 end will underdog overcome great odds triumph 
will everyone town turn coach 
will team win climactic game 
 cats bathe regularly 
 socalled hero question john moxin james van der beek senior west canaan high school plays varsity football team really just hoping get scholarship brown university can get deadend town 
 least hes got right idea since west canaan texas portrayed film frankly pathetic whole town treating weekly football games second coming 
heck one scene front page towns newspaper proclaiming west canaan badgers big win night 
 teams star quarterback severely injured tearing ligaments leg john finds taking teams leader minutes glory last long begins problems girlfriend amy smart discovers spent evening another girl ali larter 
 staying night drinking buddies strip joint teenagers film portrayed raging alcoholics team loses secondtolast game putting john feuds coach jon voight like gary oldman overstaying welcome typecasted role bad guy 
worse yet coach threatening ruin johns scholarship chances badgers dont win final game 
 plotting varsity blues old hills contains every cliche book 
admittedly never exactly bored watching hasten add rarely ever entertained 
throughout really think virtually exact story filmed great deal thoughtfulness maturity s right moves 
one biggest problems film little interest characters actually least certainly john played van der beek tvs dawsons creek pretty much bore without engaging qualities 
 probably shouldnt blame van der beek since inauspicious bythenumbers screenplay w peter iliff isnt help still certainly league tom cruise right moves 
 story revolving around john meanwhile extemely thin throughout particularly minute running time alternates uninspired comic relief students see sex education teacher working stripper club heavyhanded melodrama 
 romance john girlfriend potential adequate subplot also learned little unfortunate since amy smart dont think ive seen past films probably character written sort intelligence 
smart allow character become passive girlfriend instead coming young woman ideas opinions 
 bad camera didnt linger long enough hear thoughts 
 adult characters probably fare worse since must play residents dimwitted town cares nothing football 
johns relationship parents can also telegraphed far advance 
 father set becoming football player university john doesnt want part 
 mother stands beside big strong husband passive female 
finally jon voight plays stock bully coach character nothing make thankless role onedimensional 
saving varsity blues total washout amusing sequences including one set sex education class get laugh 
 scenes playing football wellshot thankfully didnt overstay welcome many sports films fall victim 
 leaving theater question mind film need made 
 seem asking question quite lot lately since old stories seem cranking hollywood 
 really need another highschool sports film 
 dont certainly one lowcaliber felt like cutandpaste job spare parts much better similar films 
 varsity blues doubt first one however include earnest scene one characters wearing whipped cream private parts
