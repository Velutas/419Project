 successful books movies michael crichton well 
 early successes westworld coma recent films jurassic park films entertaining 
however seems taken wrong turn somewhere sphere 
 million mess good director barry levison disclosure dull long winded huge disappointment 
considering huge budget star cast story crichton sphere majorly disappointing 
 film opens norman goodman hoffman psychologist thinks visiting airplane crash console survivors 
however arrives told supervisor barnes peter coyote actually investigating spacecraft 
along goodman mathematician harry adams jackson biologist beth halperin stone ted fielding liev schrieber 
 investigate spaceship find massive sphere inside meet alien intelligence called jerry basically weird crap happens 
unfortunately something went wrong along way sphere 
 film starts entertaining enough throughout long movie just gets sillier sillier 
 film jaunts along scene scene never fully explaining going 
 actors directing dont help either 
hoffman autopilot almost seems embarrassed throughout movie churning dull lines probably wondering hell movie 
stone useless displaying emotion fails convince audience feelings hoffman 
 person seems fun movie jackson whos funny mathematician slowly goes crazy entering sphere 
 hes hardly end film just dull hoffman stone 
 goes peter coyote hams officer killed halfway 
 director barry levinson directed better crichton adaptation disclosure messes drama action 
 drama scenes quite frankly boring action scenes suffer overkill levison throwing camera place much like godawful speed 
 writing doesnt help much either 
although crichton great plots hes terrible dialogue practically every line sphere dud 
 speech simple hoping bit intelligent 
practically every line just stating obvious 
none smart 
also hell budget go 
 sphere impressive theres nice special effect shots million went anyones guess 
theres giant squid attack picture audience see squid even though film massive budget 
 assume picture trying build tension showing squid handled correctly probably 
 whole scene done badly just hoping see stupid squid 
finally film idea genre 
levison cant handle plot 
 leaps hokey scifi horror finally shiningevent horizon psychological thriller 
 course film much like abyss although defense crichton write sphere abyss released far superior rubbish 
 bad though 
 plot right theres jump scenes although nothing scary theres occasionally interesting bit 
 overall sphere big waste fine talent lot money potentially good movie 
 really worth seeing 
overall rating review david wilcock
