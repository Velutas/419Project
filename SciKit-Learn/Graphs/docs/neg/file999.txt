 time john carpenter great horror director 
 course best film s masterpiece halloween also made s fog s underrated prince darkness 
heck even made good film mouth madness 
 something terribly wrong happened terrible comedy memoirs invisible man 
somehow carpenter lost touch junk like failed remake village damned uninspired sequel escape l movies however look like cinematic works art compared latest film john carpenters vampires 
 definately wouldnt want put name title 
 sad state affairs carpenter can make something misguided flatly written filmed vampires 
 story simple 
jack crow james woods vampire hunter along one partners montoya daniel baldwin prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives attack master vampire valek thomas ian griffith 
since katrina previously bitten crow takes along anyone bitten valek becomes telepathically linked turn vampires couple days later crow hoping find help 
 seems valeks mission steal black wooden cross roman catholic church will enable become powerful sunlight will destroy 
 question many time seen story played 
well answer just many times better version story made 
 john carpenters vampires sadly enough one unscary horror films ive ever seen 
 fact isnt even one suspenseful moment whole minute running time 
 nonstop vampire attack sequences stylelessly filmed without interesting camera work usually trademark carpenters 
 come screenplay far can tell nearly nonexistent 
 story development isnt even attempt flesh characters 
james woods can good actor nothing say couple pseudo clever lines dialogue 
daniel baldwin potential character comes dense 
 sheryl lee faring much better laura palmer twin peaks like female characters plays offensive stereotypical whore 
 ounce intelligence excitement john carpenters vamires disheartening coming exfan carpenters 
 said turned directing halloween h couldnt work excitement 
 yet asked vampires sequel said happy 
 think thats definite sign carpenter finally lost trace lasting talent mention significant number iq points
