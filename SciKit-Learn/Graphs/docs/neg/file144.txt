 definitive hollywood movie extremely predictable following basic formula horrible ending overzealous writing meaning writing bad seemed trying hard make exciting therefore making look many things merely tossed fill space tommy lee jones lovable wiseass character weve seen fugitive quite frankly wasnt used enough im afraid film completely unbearable 
 film ashley judd plays women wrongfully convicted killing husband sailing weekend 
 jail finds husband really alive framed murder 
 money original 
 jail works exercises basically best get near perfect condition 
now learned law titled double jeopardy stating serves full sentence get kill husband law touch although talk way actual law works 
now po parole officer bunch cops chasing conflicted whether believe claims 
skipping acting fact judd looker actress offense good simon birch even good great kiss girls times past believe may potential better 
 shes terribly unconvincing performance seems stale unsatisfying doesnt really add movie just takes away 
 id said jones fine although much work 
 much supporting character 
 fine handled well especially considering material work 
 feel film alot going 
originality issue 
 acting thing said keeping alive 
 plot seemed pretty intriguing well applied better 
 action scenes well made however sometimes place 
 just left unsatisfied long run 
 basically action may exciting genuinely overthought plot certainly done generally speaking movie moves way fast us get involved either characters plot basically film almost saved tommy lee jones screentime perhaps earned film higher rating book anyway 
keep mind youre mood good action film rent fugitive
