arye cross courteney cox star pair bostonians meet bar go movies fall love move together etc 
review 
well havent seen harry met sally said said dont watch love war television might think inventive film come along ages 
however youve seen seen film 
 course doesnt mean bad 
 amusing overall just ask whats point 
arye cross stereotypical single male falls love 
kevin pollack stereotypical femalefearing best friend make lot rather sexist vulgar jokes werent funny 
couteney cox stereotypical careerminded woman falls love 
julie brown stereotypical bizarre best friend said woman 
 notice frequent use word stereotypical 
 film uses lot formula plot basically known opening credits 
 good movie 
well said amusing moments 
surprisingly julie brown usually find just plain goofy best thing film 
also several funny sequences involving analysis human mating ritual 
gee really short 
 much say film really 
 just kind 
watching video might complete waste time wouldnt recommend hiring baby sitter spending lot money see theatre
