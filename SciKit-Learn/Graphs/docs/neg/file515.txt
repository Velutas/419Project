 didnt hate big hit even though stupefyingly terrible film 
 entirety running time eyes attached screen never got bored 
 found film interesting unique awfulness confused disaster film entertaining watch way entertaining witness thirty car pileup freeway spaghetti bowl 
 narrative big hit pure garbage never truly deciding genre constantly crossing kinds boundaries 
 reminded lot grosse pointe blank similar film fails lot ways 
 fine mix genres film makers know theyre 
unfortunately writer ben ramsey director kirk wong dont seem know handle material result action film wants comedy 
 biggest problem amalgamation case film absurd comedy place 
 sure fascinating failure 
marky 
 
 
er mark wahlberg stars melvin surley hitman 
hes good hitman apparently although tactics seem bit rambunctious doesnt snipe make clean killshe just kicks door shoots everything 
 works hitmencisco lou diamond phillips crunch bokeem woodbine vinnie antonio sabbato jr 
theyre nice bunch muscular guys stand around locker room working compare masturbation sex 
 work man named paris avery brooks rich powerful constant need four sloppy hitmen 
 important never go beyond boss work course plot comes 
 decide kidnap young japanese girl named keiko china chow rich father 
 turns paris 
 
 
goddaughter 
 bad paris 
 story standard action film stuff 
 nothing new nothing particularly offensive certainly slightest bit compelling 
clearly major selling point big hit john wootype action film mixed really hip comedy 
 true lot action sequences resemble recent films go idea faceoff replacement killers far superior 
 stunts fun watch opening sequence melvin two partners going kill guy nothing story 
 use night vision goggles really powerful handguns 
melvin also good breakdancing uses talent avoid bullets knives 
like said boring disasters arent 
 makes bad genreshifting madness 
 seems start quirkybutrealistic action comedy melvin seen transporting bags human remains 
 soon go first hit turns music video bodies bullets flying everywhere 
 somewhere turns back comedy 
keiko turns spunky little girl one amusing scene forced read letter loud indicating kidnapped letter littered grammatical errors skew meaning words 
 scenes like work alone wong applies goofy tone scenes serious film 
one irritating moments paris ordering cisco come office learns keiko kidnapped cisco gets paris men standing around knew cisco let telling find perpetrator 
 scene played laughs isnt funny 
 since doesnt quite work comedy tries fall back action also fails 
 film people fly fifteen feet backwards shot handgun 
cars land tree branches supported 
characters betray without second thought 
grenades thrown tight places 
people jump tall buildings survive 
people outrun tumbling cars get way falling objects small fractions seconds 
 frustrating though films definition hit man guys anything subtle quiet skilled individuals 
theyre like socially depraved militia men melvin extensive collection firearms garage including missile launchers handheld machineguns 
 characters one trait distinguishes rest obviously doesnt make deep interesting people watch 
 acting kind fun thoughwahlberg good actor innocuous presence film charming silly sort way 
phillips certainly fun psychotic character christina applegate plays melvins fianc e convincingly airheaded 
 big hit action film unknowingly spoofs trying funny 
 funniest parts supplied actors numerous failed attempts sight gags oneliners 
 true disaster one makes believe goofy unrealistic tone completely unintentional 
despite though must reiterate entertainment value 
 can cherish awfulness film like 
 embrace big hit catastrophe just might enjoy
