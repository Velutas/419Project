 easely one worst films year 
 millenium just around corner hollywood playing insecurities concerning biggest event century 
 time arnold schwartzenegger powers evil 
 result somewhat predictable 
 didnt high hopes arnolds much anticipated return big screen 
schwarzenegger fans will probably pleased action lovers wont bored catholic league will angry 
everyone else will see end days deliciously bad motion picture 
think hollywoods yk bug 
 know turn three diabolical numbers youll get 
yes better believe satan earth working latest project end days 
 time gabriel burne gets privilege play lucifer although al pacino fun behold 
 coolly strolls manhattan borrowed body investment banker wreaking say havoc 
 way works smirks something explodes 
 stroke new millennium hes got find impregnate certain woman order climb heavenly curse spelled book revelations 
 schwarzeneggers cop attached antiterrorist unit can stop 
films like one serious weakness logic 
 matter twist plot youll find incredibly stupid even schwartzenegger movie 
 incredible fact directors never learn 
 thousands headless productions theme become one big clich 
 devil looks like sex addicted maniac just got mental institution 
 walking around n y blowing everything killing everyone gets meter radius 
 wants girl somehow special 
 schwartzenegger clever looks hidden church satan dare enter 
 evil one forced seduce good cop order get valuable information can wife daughter back 
can give happiness can dream just 
give address 
indeed script like make wonderful parody unfortunately director taking subject seriously attempting create provoking dramatic thriller 
 awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback will satisfied 
weve seen 
thats didnt worthy opponent 
 battled nuclear terrorists earth power mad conspirators mars 
 taken alien predators darkest reaches jungle morphing cyberkillers seemingly nothing can stop 
 fights whats left arnold schwarzenegger 
 satan 
 opinion never quite overcome first role deadly robot camerons terminator 
 schwartzeneggers strength muscles emotions 
 tries achieve artistic level moving towards oscar 
 called adult turn successful flop unsuccessful 
make wild guess 
 character lost wife daughter serious drinking problems 
 requires least acting skills 
regrettably thing convincing old arnold muscles 
 rest cast struggling called characters 
 movie otherwise technically impressive solid cinematography fine lighting 
 movie doesnt serve neither serious thriller stupidity comic entertainment serious tone 
 real comic relief film swartzenegger tries cry 
 action sequences recycled effects everything spectacular 
 really hard time recommending film somebody 
unless diehard schwartzenegger fan stay away 
 schwarzenegger hell back
