certainly one rent ed woods glen glenda 
expecting see good movie screwy discourse transvestitism betrays level incompetence didnt know possible 
 fact woods infamous plan outer space actually seems pretty tame comparison 
watching glen glenda 
 found occasionally wondering wood originally made two three separate movies accidentally edited together result actually quite entertaining unintentionally hilarious 
 movie starts mostly seems like bad documentary endless repetitive narration transvestites difficult transvestite look girlfriends clothes without able wear transvestites necessarily homosexuals main character glenglenda reminds us probably half dozen times half man half woman man woman time 
 camera work terribleoccasionally camera lingers say closed door characters talk offscreen inexplicably zooms someones ear nose 
wood also makes copious use mostly irrelevant stock footage leads voicedover nonsequiturs like yes world busy frightening place many people driving automobiles 
finally occasional commentary bela lugosi sort omniscient seems inhabit frankensteinstyle laboratory delivering pointless lines people

 lightning crackles quasiominously overhead 
 wood continued vein glen glenda 
probably remembered nothing poorly done documentary occasional inappropriate horrormovie touch 
unfortunately wanders far left field wonder eating funny mushrooms wrote script

 another crash lightning lugosi returns time warning us beware 
 
 
beware big green dragon lurks outside door

 bizarre nightmare sequence probably meant symbolic instead just incredibly stupid ensues glenglenda finds fiance trapped fallen treein living room 
someone apparently intended sinister green dragon looks like klingon original star trek series appears orchestrating though film far clear point put kindly 
near end sceneand must confess wood lost completelyis violent sexual encounter couch features two characters even appear rest movie scored goofily upbeat folk music 
 scene ends moment soon glen glenda 
returns documentary style point lingering sense wood slightest idea pretty much gone 
 film wanders dumb happy ending also seems abandon much trying say transvestitism point didnt matter much happened 
 soon aforementioned sex scene glen glenda 
 pretty much cemented place mind incoherent film ever seen 
 honestly think picked camcorder deliberately tried make worst movie possibly still might match glen glenda 
 sheer cinematic disaster 
 giving movie f im sure quite justice
