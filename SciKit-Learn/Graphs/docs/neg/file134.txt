heres concept jeanclaude van damme gets killed within first ten minutes movie 
now isnt enough get finally see van damme movie dont know 
 sarcasm aside certainly different way start movie course minutes later find newly deceased twin brother lucky us get see jeanclaude 
van damme works russian mafia united states killed operatives 
van damme police officer france finds twin brother never knew gets killed france 
 remaining twin french cop goes united states find killed brother avenge death 
 hooks deceased brothers girlfriend played natasha henstridge two set discover murderers 
jeanclaudes acting abilities dont seem usual lackluster standards movie 
 words just case missed sarcasm acting worse normal 
 upside natasha henstridge film best species gets naked 
sadly probably high point movie 
 actually decent actress didnt improve much thought species 
 typical van damme movie jeanclaude variety high end martial arts moves opponents 
nothing new certainly nothing havent seen every van damme movie 
simply put absolutely nothing new movie 
 retread plot isnt first time jeanclaude played twins 
 still cant act 
 saw natashas breasts species although one repeat performance im complaining 
 pretty much like every movie van damme ever involved sub par
