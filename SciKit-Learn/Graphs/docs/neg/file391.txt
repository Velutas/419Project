 subject escapes real world current girlfriend laura becomes addicted virtual reality due design flaw unit recreates dead paris 
comments virtual seduction executive produced roger corman lance h robbins serves cheaplymade precursor strange days far superior film 
 movies deal desperate men trouble relating current lovers ab using technology former lovers strange days technology utilized recorded dreams rather virtual reality 
interestingly films also take place couple years now turn new millenium though strange days uses setting far effectively 
 exemplifies problem virtual seduction 
 bad lowbudget science fiction concerning psychological dangers virtual reality 
unfortunately done since much better films fact ultimately leaves scifi fan bored movie 
virtual seduction many faults one fact video inexplicably trailer begins 
 films script explores possibilities virtual reality interestingly first treatment subject matter gets heavyhanded wooden movie progresses 
many important scenes seem dark lighting improved significantly 
 cast collection veteran bmovie actors sitcom regulars mediocre job roles 
jeff fahey original lawnmower man convincingly though unenergetically plays lead character 
carrie genzel plays paris vr lover ami dolenz current love interest seems like much interesting attractive character caring personality doesnt lend credence films premise 
meschach taylor popular designing women sitcom adequately plays scientist working project performance isnt something write home either 
virtual seduction one harmless movies light manual labor mind background 
 words one fold laundry glancing every now rather boring just sit watch 
 movie surprisingly violent one expects bmovies genre still adult rrated film due sexual situations suicide attempt 
 turkey ultimately isnt awful particularly interesting unique either 
dont seduced watching movie unless youve got several loads laundry nothing else watch
