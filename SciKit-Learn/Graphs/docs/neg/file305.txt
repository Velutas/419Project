tomb raider 
fun 
exciting 
challenging 
given unprecedented popularity especially among teenage boys video game sports uberbuff pistol packin babe raids well 
tombs believe three things 
 lara croft tomb raider big screen variant said video game features pumpedup angelina jolie oscar winner girl interrupted less title role however none things 
 isnt fun isnt exciting challenge seeing long can stay seat suffered bitter bitter end wife opted barnes noble minute mark 
directed simon west subtlety brought con air tomb raider emptyheaded big budget bore 
 story borrows unintelligently mother turkeys hudson hawk hokum planetary alignments sacred stones brought together well 
 heck cares makes super mario bros bob hoskins illadvised career move look like rocco brothers classic italian neorealism 
ill go limb say suspect theres actually character development video game movie proper 
 jolie defendersvideo game nuts jump say movie isnt character development kicking serious butt bum since ms croft hails englands green pleasant 
 lips breasts biceps inflated max lara croft posturing jolie hard time simply standing still without trying look tough 
ok lets forget challenging 
shouldnt tomb raider least fun exciting 
shouldnt buttkicking heroine also encompass sophistication say james bond wit indiana jones 
theres humor found anywhere tomb raider even though tries hard time time 
even mummy returns didnt take seriously 
 villain noticeably lacking special effects ridiculously overblown unnecessarily complicated script nonexistent 
 liven things perhaps jolies live father jon voight puts minutes laras dead father lord croft talk stretch 
one thing hadnt expected film jolie affects slightly better english accent pa although suspect thinlooking moustache hes forced wear gets way 
unsuccessful entirely 
 anything lara croft tomb raider makes want check video game figure exactly fuss
