 scary 
 first words came mind 
 movie called vampires scary arent words associated 
 wasnt gripe 
john carpenter name associated cuttingedge cinema intense scares halloween thing prince darkness offbeat action live escape new york 
unfortunately thing cutting edge vampires level boredom movie able reach 
 anemic plot notquitekosher special effects john carpenters vampires barely enough substance slake thirst even least discerning genre fan 
 film first concerned group roaming vampire slayers led james woods people 
like sort holy ateam even soupedup van bunch invade wipe nest vampires new mexico shack 
 method amusingly innovative bloodsuckers reeled harpoons can flare sun like matchsticks 
 commemorate victory loutish band decorates motel room hookers parties night away 
 celebration shortlived however master vampire named valek ambushes singlehandedly destroys team 
woods jack crow buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape lives along woman named katrina sheryl lee 
although woman bitten montoya crow decide keep katrina psychic link master vampire 
 rest movie concerned boys hunt valek thomas ian griffith freaky marilyn mansontype whos mission dates back years 
along way pick priest named guiteau tim guinee character serves pretty much purpose jittery cpl 
upham saving private ryan 
 stuff happens middle movie cant remember often found twitching hair corner frame interesting happening screen 
vampires finally starts pick minutes mix crow guiteau montoya assault abandoned prisonturned vampire nest 
 film begin even resemble carpenter flick 
 little late 
 get inevitable final confrontation seems tacked rather anticlimactic come dealing master vampire 
interestingly last summers vampire actioner blade derived comic book vampires novel yet latter seems steeped campy cheesiness former deliberate superhero flick 
woods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners strolls away exploding buildings ohsocool stride 
 motive killing vampires 
take wild guess 
 hint killed just 
 least blade decent action slick stylishness 
vampires lacks even cheap thrills mask gossamerthin plot 
 make movie resorts shocks generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps around fun overplayed contempt religion crow teases guiteau incessantly whether vow celibacy made prone getting woodies 
 can argued maybe wanted much movie 
 scary gory wanted tense relentless exhausting 
john carpenters vampires none 
 can recommended hardcore carpenter fan 
 rest looking good scare beware vampires film teeth
