 one arrogant critics thinks review great impact success failure certain films might say review movies dont look particularly good im service readers warning seeing 
 true put banner top site reads shay casey seeing bad movies dont 
 know thats bunkyoure going see whatever movies want matter say 
 tell truth every get nasty masochistic urge see bad movie 
 know feeling youre sick seeing damn academy award contenders want see something can ball trashing mercilessly 
sometimes think thats anyone goes see pauly shore movies ever 
admit sometimes like seeing bad movies 
 
 saw supernova 
truth told supernova wasnt quite bad thought might 
maybe just felt sorry actors maybe thought decent studio hadnt started tinkering directors walter hill final cut causing want name removed 
maybe im becoming softy 
 case didnt find supernova bad advance buzz believe 
 still bad 
 film takes place aboard medical space vessel nightingale 
 crew includes captain j 
marley robert forster new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips danika lund robin tunney computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz 
 attempts characterization means nick shady past involving drug addiction puts kaela edge yerzy danika relationship requires make kissyfaces every five minutes benj apparently gay love computer apparently female 
dont expect explanation wont get 
anyway crew gets distress call location deep space failed mining operation sent 
 dimension jump think thats called dont hold captain killed man sent distress signal peter facinelli brought board 
 calls troy larson making supposed son man kaela relationship 
 bunch really predictable stuff starts happening 
 seen alien 
 seen event horizon lame movie right 
good 
 youve seen supernova 
postproduction cuts nothing original screenplay nothing unpredictable either 
 ones going think second troy wont turn villain 
 bigger problem supernova can t just stick simple plot afforded 
numerous rewrites script may credited three people gross underestimate crammed lean minute film tons extraneous plot threads remain underdeveloped 
 something limping robot shaped like fighter pilot 
 ships computer learn something humanity 
 glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought board 
 just films title signify anything 
 far can tell refers small plot detail isnt developed just like rest unnecessary story elements 
character relationships film also make little sense 
 reason every person film keeps sex 
 get unusually early sex scene phillips tunney within first minutes 
bassett spaders characters start hating 
fifteen minutes one bottle pear brandy later theyre engaging hankypanky 
 troy creepy stranger shows ship course female crew members will fall love 
every single shift character interaction happens extremely suddenly one many obvious clues much film cut 
 prominent example however may fact film starts opening credits 
furthermore end film looks like took originally intended opening credits spliced right real end credits 
maybe thats films title mentioned twice end credits right james spader robert forster 
right get shock told movie youre seeing lest decide walk upon making discovery might notice movie seems dropped right middle scene littletono introduction characters situations 
 rest movie feels like skipped middle stuff character changes know explain things just went point point b point danika thoroughly enamored yerzy ready baby 
point b tunney now shagging troy yerzy unusually obsessed lava lamp thing 
doesnt make sense 
since didnt understand anything characters motivations care troy abruptly starts murdering onebyone knocking three minutes 
 whit 
 shame cast contains lot talented actors looking something 
 dont find 
bassett spader say every line monotone voice blank expressions faces 
sexual tension 
 like constipation 
maybe theyre just embarrassed utter howlers thing made someone powerful god whole lot less nice 
 ever find mind 
 climax relationship taking place transport pod probably films biggest foreheadslapper 
 troy peter facinelli inhabits obvious villain history one ever suspected 
 s awfully onenote hes given notes work 
 rest cast even less 
tunney stands around looking cute scared 
phillips broods 
cruz flirts computer 
 die star blows something really wasnt paying much attention 
 supernova pretty awful im cutting little slack merely expected less got 
thats 
 expect good whatever reasons may youll probably hate will 
even special effects fairly unimpressive nothing haven t seen suffice say script isnt going save film 
honestly though expect film dozen writers director name removed replaced pseudonym 
 usually results bad movie thats supernova
