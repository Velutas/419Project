sometimes decide write short story poem think title first think subject go 
 seems makers disturbing behavior similar train thought came title sequence 
 wouldnt surprised couple guys got together created opening credits someone saw made story go along 
 title sequence good ominous original engrossed picture even began 
 course attention dwindled shortly film 
disturbing behavior like many thrillers starts interesting ends laughably ridiculous 
 teen horror film interesting violence sex 
 suspense film suspense 
 evil small town story story speak 
 disaster listless uninspired disaster just barely misses onestardom good sequences mercifully short running time one terrific set opening credits 
 main man fellow named steve clark blandly played jimmy marsden 
 moves small town family tragically brother shoots 
steve upset untimely death brother learn strange homevideo like nightmares occasionally 
 big trial steve course fit school make new friends 
marsden looks like stereotypical jock last detail seems poor casting choice social reject 
 social reject falls pretentious dopesmoking philosophers gavin nick stahl rachel katie holmes 
gavin informs steve local group jocks known blue ribboners actually bunch zombies assimilating new members group sporadically killing innocent people 
 group mismatched protagonists solve mystery something 
 end something happened things explained film still doesnt make sense 
disturbing behavior written scott rosenberg 
ive seen name around recently one toucheruppers armageddon script imagine part knows hes comes screenwriting 
 however complete lapse judgement got idea film decided actually take time write 
evil small town films pretty common last one phantoms also dismal failure takes lot skill make formula work 
rosenbergs script complete mess lacking even basic attempts characterization 
 makes sense purpose things finally explained 
 supposed element surprise see happening jocks film never explains exactly happening 
 get strapped chairs microchip inserted eyes poof become sexcrazed superviolent machinelike creatures 
 doctor responsible dr caldicott bruce greenwood must pretty nuts thinking kind behavior step way high school jocks actually behave perhaps realistic element film 
much writing simply bad rosenberg intuition comes way high school kids act 
 one terrible scene gavin explains steve high school cliques pointing cafeteria 
 front say four years high school eat cafeteria even 
 aside various social groups points general uninteresting poorlyshown 
 instance points nerds wearing glasses playing laptops 
 obvious cliche cant believe rosenberg even bothered 
 dialogue forced one says bite 
anymore none scenes degree wit 
 picture inspired scenes flop one sense momentum energy 
 blame can placed director david nutter apparently likes films dry 
horror films least exploit violence one shockingly timid 
 good scenes though interesting trip insane asylum however forced scene film heroes get bother things never learn 
 also liked school janitor character played william sadler 
 lines surprisingly thoughtprovoking 
 acting largely waste talent 
marsden said bland thought particularly bad 
bruce greenwood shamelessly wasted 
stahl holmes show talent direction isnt good enough hone skills stahls performance seems like parody high school potheads 
none characters expand beyond one dimension frankly watching cardboard cutouts human beings run hallways screaming just isnt cool 
disturbing behavior wreck film started wreck shooting even began 
im surprised producers read script thought make good film make lot money box office 
 boring even blatantly awful uninspired lump film 
 sure starts nicely regression total absurdity consistent last scene outright laughable 
 go see film take advice appreciate credit sequence pray never ends
