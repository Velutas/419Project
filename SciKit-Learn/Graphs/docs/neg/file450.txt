ive always kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates penzance even hamlet pbs great performances 
 minute saw trailer film resolved see 
besides fact kline starred looked like hilarious film 
 got sucker punched trailer extent however also thought wow theres much funny stuff trailer must ton laughs rest film 
 oops packed wife headed les cinemas del diablo name local multimultiplex 
 film began 
 film concerns englishdrama teacher suburban high school named howard brackett 
 loves poetry great literary works class interested famous former student played matt dillon 
 id put name wife wont let take notes movie ive forgotten 
 continually interrupt long poetic expositions fawning questions 
brackett engaged another teacher played joan cusack three years finally gotten gumption marry 
 wedding however becomes big question mark film famous student says live oscar broadcast brackett homosexual 
kline spends first twothirds film frantically trying convince everyone isnt 
 whole town begins examine every detail life begins identifying things confirm sexual preference 
 closest friends dont help matters bringing nothing barbara streisand laserdiscs stag party 
 genuinely hilarous moments one involving tape geared towards helping men assert masculinity 
kline hounded gay reporter played tom selleck waxes poetic benefits coming time best exploit situation sleazy tabloid machinations 
 movie moves along fine slowly builds climax wedding 
kline stands altar asked take vows 
 want surprised dont read going reveal ending 
 instead saying front parents town even cameras says im gay 
 movie opinion falls apart 
 humor film come klines insistence straight time loving poetry senstivie guy dressing well occaisionally acting prissy 
 reminded effeminate heterosexual sketch saturday night live 
 funny sustainably funny klines performance made doubly 
however wedding film drags 
 attempted come quick conclusion gets serious side hes done 
 reconciles parents friends turned 
 several scenes seemed like waste time scene mother friends hilarious seemed pointless scene tom selleck bar joan seemed pointless 
finally even though catholic found scene priest condescending 
 preist believe man engaged three years consumated relationship proclaiming brackett third person hes gay 
 got chuckle audience distracted began tire film 
 time wedding come gone found hoping soon 
 much like review saying 
overall quantify say rising action gets climax falling action gets 
see economy time
