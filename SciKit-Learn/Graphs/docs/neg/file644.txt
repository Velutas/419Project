kids today dont just want see heartthrob master thespian freddie prinze jr loving ladies 
 want see something takes little acting department namely playing baseball 
 series drippy voiceovers informed theres better proving ground major league baseball cape cod summer baseball leagues college alsorans hopeful dropouts go play hopes attracting big league attention 
 man freddie landed spot pitcher prestigious chatham hoping big break 
 given ample time show abs scamper womans thong dont ask learn real story summer catch will prinze poor townie named ryan dunne struggling make name neither father fred ward brother jason gedrick pulled blue collar jobs resent anyone tries local beauty tenley tenley 
 jessica biel far league probably shouldnt even bother 
 course makes play 
summer catch also makes abortive stab another half dozen subplots jealousy fellow townie brazen slut dee dee brittany murphy alienation felt ryans nonbaseball playing best friend gabriel mann fat chick fetish fellow player miles marc blucas 
worst ludicrous bit involving s shows wilmer valderrama beverly dangelo appear film simply provide nutty mrs robinsonlike substory remind much better done bull durham 
 fact virtually summer catch feels like done better somewhere else 
 starters film major question identity 
 definitely sports movie fails pretty miserably romance 
 worst part amateurish script cowritten arli writing alumnus guy starred leprechaun chockfull phony emotion 
 end becomes platform character deliver soliloquy ryan must take heart 
dad hand give fatherly yet drunken advice 
coach brian dennehy just loving fact hes got work big screen hand give curmudgeonly counterpoint 
ryans catcher matthew lillard playing hand tell ryan play catch make fun fat fetish guy 
ryans stoner best friend hand give gogetemtigerwerebehindyou talk 
 girlfriend hand give heartwarmingnuzzlyfollowyourdreams counsel 
 long start wonder freddy prinze jr capable thought 
dont answer 
 real joy film found biels character just skimpy outfits also usually wet 
shes one movie able much role taking rebellingagainstdaddy character least passing grade 
 shes screen time flies 
 shes realize ungodly reason movie almost two hours long 
 pg teen romance despite nearconstant sexual innuendo one ask warner brothers thinking 
 part biel fallen far th heaven roots almost become denise richards 
hollywood either eat alive 
 vice versa 
either way good luck jessica 
 freddie keeps pumping teen romances rate two year prinzes next summer catch liable venereal disease
