 cigarettes takes place new years eve 
monica played martha plimpton huge new years party 
everyone town trying get caught things 
 basic plot cigarettes 
 meet characters headed towards party sent many subplots unoriginal interesting 
 disappointed greatly 
 film party people trying get opinion 
lucy played courtney love kevin played paul rudd 
 two relationship friendship starts blossom something 
 subplot extremely boring dull getting quite sick plots like 
janeane garofalo involved another subplot dealing kevin 
 plays ellie exgirlfriend kevins 
 subplot completely waste garofalos talent 
 point hardly even movie 
 lucy runs bartender played ben affleck another subplot formed 
 bartender invited lucy come monicas party 
 bar runs two girls 
 girls played angela featherstone nicole parker unfortunately due terrible acting dont even remember characters names 
ben affleck good actor character doesnt go anywhere doesnt much screen time give good performance 
featherstone parker horrible roles part reason film bad 
christina ricci plays val gaby hoffman plays stephie 
 two girls trying get party extremely lost 
 meet guys end going around night 
 subplot alright quite annoying stephies accent 
hoffman okay job acting ricci good 
 underused considering wonderful actress 
another subplot film relationship cindy played goldie hawns daughter jack played jay mohr 
jack actor doesnt care girls goes just likes dates one night next day doesnt 
kate hudson huge klutz 
 gets funny situations funniest parts entire movie 
 probably funny parts entire movie well 
 subplot used mainly due hudsons performance 
mohr wasnt good wasnt bad 
 just alright didnt find acceptable 
 much say performances film 
none characters developed shown enough really tell acting good 
 performances can judge christina riccis always good performance kate hudsons funny role courtney loves mediocre performance paul rudds annoying overused performance 
 hoping little jaw mohr ben affleck casey affleck gaby hoffman dave chapelle especially janeane garofalo 
 two strongest things film great soundtrack original costumes 
martha plimpton christina ricci different original outfits made feel like year 
 soundtrack full s tunes ranging want candy tainted love 
 songs movie also helped create feel back s 
 film often found asking questions reason 
 moral story 
 point 
 events going film necessary 
 care lucy kevin going 
 movie extremely boring time reached elevenoclock one hour midnight wait movie 
 plot okay subplots make terrible 
maybe film party people party lot better 
 bottom line just like slasher movie s comedy just one many
