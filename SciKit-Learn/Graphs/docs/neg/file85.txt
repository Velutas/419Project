brian de palma director bought us carrie dressed kill mission impossible back bought technical expertise 
sadly forget bring good story believable characters 
nic cage plays rick santaro fast talking cop watching boxing match friend commander kevin dunne sinise 
 assassination takes place santaro tries peace together took place trying work roles people involved conspiracy 
 film uses flashbacks video cameras bring mystery together 
however film doesnt keep mystery long big secret concerning kevin dunne film dead end 
although fantastic shots de palma including minute steadicam shot start film halfway film drops dead 
 problem de palma doesnt strong story characters work 
 tries offshoot flashy camera techniques pretty soon effect audience quickly got bored 
nic cage gary sinise try inject life poorly realised characters use 
 boring faceless completely unlikeable 
yes another problem film theres noone root 
 supposed cages side character becomes nicer throughout film 
however change sadly unbelievable 
poor gary sinises character terrible completely changes throughout start middle end appalling way 
 films use flashback quickly gets boring 
 clever interesting first times quickly becomes apparent flashbacks used film nowhere go 
 certainly dont increase tension suspense movie 
 small thread suspense running film certainly doesnt make film powerhouse thriller rather just slightly average one 
 script lousy contrived characters flat two dimensional 
certainly good factors film passing thriller 
 depressing aspect film potential 
theres good story buried snake eyes just bogged razzle dazzle flashbacks 
 also gives away far quickly rather leaving big twist end 
 performances intriguing especially newcomer carla gugino sexy number cruncher wrapped case theres way altering fact snake eyes terminal case style substance unless youre big fan either cage flash directing avoided
