shes werewolf cursed change hideous beast moon full make matters worse suffered nasty bite 
actress julie delpy far good movie 
 imbues serafine spirit spunk humanity gives us emotional stake characters fate 
 isnt necessarily good thing since prevents us relaxing enjoying american werewolf paris completely mindless campy entertainment experience 
delpys injection class otherwise classless production raises specter film better script better cast surrounding

julie bowen happy gilmore suitably fetching werewolf meat 
 respected french actor thierry lhermitte brief turn another monster meal 
 technical side bad news 
 computergenerated werewolves look painfully unreal 
 creatures probably believable men wolf suits 
repeated use made werewolf cam infrared wolfs pointofview approach thats interesting first couple times employed becomes tedious 
 soundtrack includes alternative grunge rock tunes clash violently onscreen action theyre matched 
director anthony waller displayed confident edgy style mute witness stumbles material never able make comedy horror elements gel 
 result get worst werewolf sequel since howling ii sister werewolf 
 will give waller credit killing dog though something thats rarely seen movies days american werewolf paris marginally entertaining bad movie sort way thats dubious distinction 
ultimately unfortunate effort isnt unbearable sit isnt howl either
