unfortunately much going youre given enough time one predicament effectively shocked new twist comes 
 just one way director john mcnaughton fails make movie fun couldve 
 minutes fly although never feels underdeveloped pretzel storytelling couldve much richly realized slower pace taken 
 acting incredibly reminiscent fox primetime soap operas good thing 
 just campbell happens hail primetime fox soap party five everyone suffers heavily melodramatic overtones
