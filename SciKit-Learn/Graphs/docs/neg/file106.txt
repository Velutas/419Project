third times charm 
plot james west artemus gordon chosen president find man responsible kidnapping nations top scientists threatening take united states within week 
critique laugh entire picture 
 consider film partcomedy thats good sign 
 also tense particularly enjoy unenergetic action sequences provided little minutes time think back lovely salma hayek scenes 
 consider part film geared actionadventure say another negative sign 
 consider first hour film boring little slow storyline tired reminiscent swiss cheese uninvolving special effects interesting worth little inside plot filled lame oneliners weak characterizations anticlimactic end pretty much gist impression big summer blockbuster 
 blows 
 say french eet blows 
 script crappy took four people write 
maybe 
 special effects dont show last half hour even dont see anything trailers hadnt already given away
