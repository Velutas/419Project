 confession 
even though movie junkiei saw eye beholder yet still watch moviesive never seen original godzillas 
 note godzilla sequel u s godzilla released american release godzilla flick called gojira nisen mireniamu 
 part excited drove local multiplex see godzilla latest entry almost year old franchise 
 longawaited treat 
 expecting goofy good time complete bad dubbing science fair level sets ludicrous plot line 
 last thing expected movie boring 
 can imagine theatre full kids saw felt 
 get bad theyre good traits normally associated franchise 
 sit snoozer plot organization rorschach blot 
 deal wasnt willing accept 
hiroshi kashiwabara waturu mimuras script crams way many details many cases fails follow 
 maneuver disconcerting gives movie permanent logy weighty feel 
godzilla starts destroying power plants just stops 
 whim 
 bold political statement 
 dont know 
 foe ancient meteor looks like prudentials logo doesnt just fight beast far east 
 got lifesaving powers plot erase data japan desire clone ability become spaceship kind tentacled space creature 
theres battle head godzilla prediction unit takehiro murata slimy government official hiroshi abe handling godzilla personal issues 
 theres plucky news photographer blah blah blah 
 like watching magnolia againexcept without good writing keen sociological insight aimee mann songs 
 waste 
 talking plot points stop hurtling godzilla jobits entertaining goes easy 
 action scenes cheesy grandeur though little sluggish 
 dubbing nice awful murata sounding like hes constant need cough drop 
 dialogue one line summarizes goofiness factor anyone see flying rock go 
 movie also marked first time since three stooges ive heard word imbecile used casual conversation 
though summer movie season drying godzilla moments wouldnt take kids see 
theyll probably end asking questions charlie rose
