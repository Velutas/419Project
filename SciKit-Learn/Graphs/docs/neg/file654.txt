 real mccoy 
 charmless molassesslow full genuinely stupid people film commission atlanta real mccoy set might well consider sort ritual suicide complicity humiliation 
 real mccoy opens bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger arrested middle job 
six years later karen parole looking stay straight 
 soon bumps j t barker val kilmer hapless wouldbe thief idolizes karen 
j t also ties jack schmidt terence stamp man blew whistle karen six years earlier refusing work 
schmidt cahoots karens sleazy parole officer gailard sartain wants karen help stage robbery 
 time leverage karens kidnapped son 
just thought keep pulling back 
contrivances sloppy plotting fly screen fast furiously duck avoid hit 
leading list jack schmidt character unexplained presumably foul mains already extremely wealthy story begins 
 reason given need want get involved another crime let alone actually participate breakin 
karens initial encounter j t botched convenience store holdup also strains limits credibility 
 simple enough somehow entangled point instead run next day theyre leaving parole officers exactly moment 
small world eh 
 theres convenient car trouble attempted escape pet tigers power laws bad cinema must inevitably confront someone blundered cage 
however buffoon prize goes atlanta police come like keystone kops bad day 
 fun doesnt end shambles script william davies william osborne 
 also absence single solitary interesting character 
karen earnest singleminded motherly devotion lacking kind edge make convincing criminal basinger thespian adept fleshing flimsy material 
schmidt flaccid villain parole officer complete blank karens son exhusband might well furniture 
 kilmers j t remotely appealing one potentially intriguing quality ineptitude never developed 
 fact kilmer disappears middle film just admiration karen made interesting subplot 
 might forgiving pacing appropriate caper comedy real mccoy goes nowhere fast 
various scenes sneaking skulking seem take forever end reason evident didnt end cutting room floor 
even reasonably clever climactic breakin falls victim syndrome including scene one thieves drilling open vault lasts kid four minutes 
 tension scene just tedium 
russell mulcahy highlander director style indeed real mccoy looks reasonably good completely stumbles editing room 
 many big problems real mccoy im tempted overlook little ones 
like karen disarming one schmidts henchmen throwing gun middle park son playing 
like fountain crushed van runs reappearing one piece moments later 
tempted im pretty good resisting temptation
