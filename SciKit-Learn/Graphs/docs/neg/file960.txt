 virus monster movie without monster 
 movie hurdle large overcome better pretty damn good otherwise 
sadly virus deliver level 
 movie opens russian space station mir transmit something never find big boat lots satellites 
sudddenly wave colorful lightning comes flying space winds destroying mir using transmit aforementioned big boat 
cut seven days later meet donald sutherland band seafaring vultures 
see spend time sailing around looking deadinthewater ships rescue collect reward money 
 least think thats 
along many things film reason middle ocean isnt really explained 
 stumble upon big boat lots satellites decide haul back russian waters 
 problem crew starts disappearing onebyone turning borg 
yes borg 
complete red laser beam place eye 
apparently alien lifeform can survive inside something electrical 
 creates makeshift machines uses humans spare parts 
blah blah blah 
 go forever describing ludicrous socalled plot wont 
suffice say original thing movie donald sutherland play irish man 
everything else movie taken better movies 
 example many machines resemble found littleseen japanese movie tetsuothe iron man 
 plot right aliens 
 funny thing actually expecting enjoy movie 
 soft spot cheesy monster movies like last years underappreciated deep rising 
 virus mentioned earlier doesnt even monster 
 just big pile circuits wires expects audience fear ridiculous looking contraption 
 virus type movie really makes wonder screenwriter thinking wrote 
besides lame monster chock full dialogue real person ever say situations real person ever allow get 
 example scene late movie one characters actually attempts negotiate alien 
now dont know came upon lifeform viewed mankind virus eliminated doubt attempt reason 
 makes much sense baby squirrel calmly asking fierce predator spare life 
finally virus isnt scary 
 least filmmakers done make movie just little scary 
 frightening box cookies 
skip virus 
 cool monster movie want rent far superior granddaddy genre aliens
