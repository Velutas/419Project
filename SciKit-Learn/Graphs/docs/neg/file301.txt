 first clue something isnt gonna quite right movie youre see heavily christmasthemed release date oh say end february 
 second clue something isnt gonna quite right movie youre see charlize theron one movies dubious stars makes appearance daily show asked new movies good replies equivalent verbal sigh 
assuring us yeah sure movie right 
 theres scenes like youd expect find movie theres action 
 theres 
stuff 
 
 immediately grab attention open movie five dead guys santa claus suits 
 show caption reading six days earlier 
ya know honestly interested find killed poor santas 
 immediately lose attention follow opening scene terminally dull niceguyswhodontdeservetobeinprison scene 
write line one prisoners like just want go home eat christmas dinner watch ball dad 
 ben affleck actually say line film forget leave cutting room floor 
 good measure throw poorly motivated prison riot afflecks best buddy stabbed 
aw 
 just two days release 
already cliches piled thick rains pours 
 take attention dash violently rocks make im contemplating strategy calling shotgun hour know credits will roll deny characters ability think 
 ben affleck reason ill never understand pretend hes dead prison buddy can get girlfriend played charlize theron 
 gary sinise show force two participate poorly planned casino heist 
 villains big idea 
kidnap affleck used security guard casino force tell doors place dress santa suits create diversions rob place 
 paper seems like stuff potential caper comedy veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks piece paper thinks hes looking makings sort clever actioncrime thriller 
 like man isnt capable 
far 
hes man responsible classic political thrillers like manchurian candidate seven days may 
 wowed memorable car chases ive ever seen last years ronin 
 hes certainly guilty churning certifiable losers 
put reindeer games shelf shame version island dr moreau 
step one making movie easily forgotten possible cast ben affleck role worlds generic hero 
 gets good oneliners doesnt get shoot implode anything new interesting ways know regrets past car thief wants cup hot chocolate piece pecan pie 
 name rudy short rudolph likelihood 
see called reindeer games 
get 
get 
shut 
 past affleck best supporting actor reindeer games nothing viability leading man 
step two making movie easily forgotten possible gary sinises villain dresses looks like standard movie crook filmmaker 
hes dirty pottymouthed hes got long scruffy hair goatee fully expected walk casino carrying sacks giant dollar signs 
hes also extremely inept 
 thinks garish cowboy costumes santa suits make acceptable disguises trusts afflecks character pull even time time time tricks lies nearly kills 
 instead tapping comic possibilities role sinise seems think hes playing sort tough smart smooth criminal mastermind rather complete moron obviously written script 
 side note gary sinise wins weeks title 
award hes one gets awkwardly cram name movie one lines early proceedings 
last weeks winner natasha henstridge whole nine yards 
 take bad idea make things worse include two three plot twists instead making apparently stupidity plan seem suddenly intelligent make plan seem even ridiculous unlikely 
 bad movie 
 whats worse except moments near notsostunning conclusion preposterous replaced ludicrously preposterous reindeer games never really gives us satisfaction laughably bad 
 theyd done much least entertained
