 movie divorce custody seems timely movie mood rings 
family breakups familiar part american landscape nearly thirty years countless dramas told stories acrimonious court battles handwringing detail 
still cant recall comedy subject bye bye love 
 still cant 
bye bye love rarely funny often weak melodramatic retread common tvmovie fare 
 moments nothing films main premise offer big laughs instead cliched emotion 
bye bye love follows one weekend lives three divorced fathers get weekend custody children 
dave matthew modine father two inveterate womanizer difficulty staying faithful latest girlfriend vic randy quaid foulhumored father three go rare date donny paul reiser pines exwife trouble relating teenage daughter emma eliza dushku 
 course weekend three men face various crises including vics blind date hell janeane garofolo donnys growing estrangement emma 
 three lead actors form rather unlikely combo quality performances widely varying quality 
randy quaid best three bitter without irritating gleefully spiteful without frightening 
 runins exwife lindsey crouse bit overplayed though confrontation pompous radio psychologist rob reiner gimmicky implausible 
 get bye bye loves best subplot hilarious dinner date gloriously demented janeane garofolo great slow burn 
paul reiser really one character slightly befuddled uptight nice guy mad persona well 
 personality appealing character becomes pretty boring 
matthew modine quite simply terrible 
 isnt performance good enough called mailedin even forgot put stamp 
modine lacks charm appallingly underwritten role looks bored time gets stuck trite little speech fathers fault hes cad 
carolcos executives whose entire future resting modines bankability upcoming cutthroat island must sweating buckets right now 
bye bye love basically comes confused movie spends far much time new relationships main characters instead relationships fathers kids making just another dating s movie 
 movie deal children one scream accusation andor cry perhaps resolved later sensitive talk hug perhaps 
even confusing subplot featuring late ed flanders widower goes work mcdonalds befriends troubled youth 
 sad end flanders career getting caught truly annoying overuse mcdonalds location plot device apparently major advertiser 
even bye bye love decided spend time focusing exclusively parentchild relationships still pretty difficult pull ultimately little humor one can wring family breakups effects children 
 way slice bad situation kids makers bye bye love mostly go heartstrings dealing single parenting issue 
 left dads romantic fumblings probide little humor isnt enough 
 comparisons bye bye love parenthood parenthood genuinely funny genuinely touching 
bye bye love genuine shame
