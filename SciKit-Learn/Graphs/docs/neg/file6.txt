capsule planet mars police taking custody accused murderer face title menace 
 lot fighting whole lot story otherwise 
john carpenter reprises many ideas previous films especially assault precinct new film comes homage 
 
john carpenter apparently believes action scenes people fight something horrible horror scenes 
 writer director horror films supposedly expert horror bad mistake make 
ghosts mars called horror movie just drawn fight humans surprisingly lowpowered alien menace 
 addition anybody john carpenter made ghosts mars carpenter grounds sue 
 film just chock full pieces taken assault precinct thing prince darkness 
 fact surprising carpenter managed fit many pieces previous work film admittedly novel way 
 still make really good science fiction experience 
ghosts mars takes place year 
mars mostly terraformed humans can walk surface without breathing gear good films budget 
 never mentioned gravity mars increased somehow earthnormal making easier film 
society changed bit time advanced surprisingly little 
apparently culture changed women much positions control 
 carpenters view women really made mess things 
society stagnated female control beyond minor technological advances society changed less years might expect change ten 
 basic plot ghosts mars much common assault precinct except precinct yes precinct replaced somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony 
instead criminal napolean wilson film criminal desolation williams 
instead facing hoodlums automatic weapons police face well ghosts mars 
 ghosts somewhat alien nature behave alien manner essentially behave human savages another lapse imagination 
 story told flashback flashback within flashback flashback within flashback within flashback 
ghosts mars takes place entirely night filmed almost entirely tones red yellow black 
carpenter manages give us powerful opening scene showing mining train rushing martian night sound music heavy beat 
sadly follows really buildup 
 terror creates looks little much like fugitive wannabes rock band kiss 
 idea building suspense bunch sudden jump scenes sucker viewer thinking something scary happening prove just something boring 
 standard haunted house film shock effects require great talent give audience 
somewhat newer also unimpressive cgi digital decapitations fights 
within short stretch time seen release mission mars red planet ghosts mars 
 mission mars panned many reviewers looks better better better time goes 
 rate ghosts mars scale scale 
following movie showed wife liked ghosts mars moderately carpenters classic assault precinct 
 comment seeing film twice
