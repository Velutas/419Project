like sully perfect storm tough gruff little bit scary 
 law albino alligator tough gruff little bit scarier 
 colonel william sharp armageddon dwayne engelman strange days even brief appearance towards beginning pearl harbor abusive father dannyhere actor gravitates towards tough gruff hardhitting roles 
 performance whats worst happen 
 shock delight 
 film fichtner plays blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dogloving detective 
 alex tardio fichtners performance borders caricature goes beyond 
 borders offensive doesnt really manage 
 borders clich d stereotype doesnt quite succumb definition either 
 role diametrically opposed actor played seen coming fichtner isnt perfectyou can see struggling little times concentrating little hard look swishes hand air nuzzles coiffed canine close personalbut hes pretty damned good silly without question best thing film 
 fact fitchners sudden bizarre appearance jarring screen presence thereafter walked whats worst happen 
 mesmerizing awfulness poorly written haphazardly edited totally unfunny yes stars martin lawrence danny devito possible 
moviegoing experience 
fichtners performance doesnt exactly save film like im recommending whats worst happen 
solely strength actors dramatic turnaround contributions raise films rating stars oneandahalf 
thumbs fichtner thumbs downway way downto everyone else involved sorry mess movie dull pedestrian nonsensical doesnt even warrant discussion
