several days seen movie im still trying determine director christopher guest man whose sense humor usually appreciate found funny either concept execution almost heroes 
 dreadful motion picture lowbrow example period piece comedy terrible production values exceptionally poor laughstojokes ratio 
theres kind desperation movies approach humor reveals film makers uncertainty entertaining material manic style betrays lastditch attempt hide flaws failed script 
 premise doesnt sound especially amusing begin almost heroes tells tale two explorers effeminate leslie edwards matthew perry uncouth bartholomew hunt chris farley racing lewis clark trip american northwest 
edwards hunt accompanied kinds weirdoes find road movies albeit earlyth century variety including frenchman named guy fontenot claims speak hundreds languages none prove useful pretty indian maiden turns obligatory love interest bizarre man suffers series debilitating injuries 
along way intrepid explorers encounter bears bald eagles aging native american warriors conquistador named hildago kevin dunn raves beautiful hair 
 explorers trek takes forests across snowcapped rocky mountains waterfall 
 setup leads lot shouting great deal lunacy laughs 
farley engages usual shtick falling bellowing aside momentarily diverting confrontation eagle heart doesnt seem 
matthew perry one stars tvs friends modest success romantic comedy fools rush badly miscast 
 foil farley antidote runaway energy perry lacks necessary edge proverbial straight man 
im big fan david spade didnt like tommy boy least farley worked well together 
 far supporting players go none makes fleeting impression 
eugene levy wasted kevin dunn interesting godzilla 
frankly disappointment see something dumb ugly come christopher guest brilliant comic force behind films spinal tap big picture waiting guffman 
although guest gets costumes right nearlyinconsequential success substitute weak script unfunny execution 
 special effects execrable 
 example really poor blue screen work look scenes characters shooting rapids theyre obviously getting buckets water thrown farley carried eagle 
even though farley didnt stellar acting careers doesnt deserve kind unfortunate epitaph offered almost heroes 
 outrageous attempts humor may coax guffaws year old boys level comedy almost heroes falls far level sophomoric 
farley fans see film way say goodbye commended loyalty since takes real stamina stay seated full running length cinematic torture session
