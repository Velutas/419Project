 think maybe time batman series put rest 
 first two films unsettling insight really take someone make superhero abandoned one throws lingering realism window goes allout camp traces selfmocking restraint relatively lighthearted third installment 
let give example first scene movie batman george clooney robin chris odonnell summoned museum literally turned ice mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger attempt steal diamond 
mr freezes thugs armed none hockey sticks problem heroes automatic skates shoot shoes point robin manages get hold hockey stick grabs diamond stickhandles museum 
 might expected airplanestyle farce dont think thats movie supposed 
 previous three batman movies actually fairly realistic standards superheroaction genre kept corny deathdefying stunts minimum playing obligatory cheesiness least amount irony 
 list goes one 
robin holds onto outside flying rocket ship feet high atmosphere climbing door save batman 
mr freeze poison ivy uma thurman leap skyscraper survive landing small pond 
 world dominating mad scientist lives fortress seems stolen old heman cartoons 
 favorite example scene batgirl alicia silverstone gets race motorcycle thugs come clever notion dousing road gasoline setting fire distract 
 bad wouldnt police maybe batman 
notice road fire 
 knew gotham city crazy anarchic place 
 
 
 
 also seems creators batman movies obeying unwritten rule main characters plot lines successive installment 
 three protagonists two villains werent enough batman robin weighs underdeveloped side story failing health bruce waynes butler alfred michael gough might seemed poignant wasnt surrounded much silliness well several scenes elle macpherson bruces girlfriend serve purpose remind us movie 
 might semiexcusable story interesting entertaining isnt 
 fact kind boring 
mr freeze poison ivy pale comparison villains past baddies jack nicholsons joker danny devitos penguin 
 evil plot predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounces words today gotham city tomorrow world 
 lamebrained didnt ever occur poison ivy freezing entire world kill precious plants 
 robins constant challenging batman mostly just makes look bullheaded stupid makes us wonder batman ever taken partner first place 
strip away stars fancy set design status batman movie another barely passable summer action flick
