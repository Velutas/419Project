 job film critic see movie write review tells good bad 
 feel kind embarrassed admit seen get carter really cant tell although go bad movie 
 get carter falls category movies continue made reasons unknown anyone outside hollywood executive board room 
 might call steven seagalmickey rourkejeanclaude van dammewesley snipes school mediocre actioncrime thrillers 
 know potboilers heavy fistfights shootouts car chases really light plot character development 
 stories socalled hero just keeps running characters connection one characters antagonists without reason movie give protagonist someone fight chase shoot 
sylvester stallone stars jack carter las vegasbased mob enforcer returns home brothers funeral 
 believes brother richie taken didnt die dwi accident 
carters one cliche badasses ever captured celluloid 
 face alone pretty intimidating theres quite scenes leans regular citizens criminal lowlives simply staring speaking confidence ramboontestosteronetherapy voice 
stallones performance movie forced unnatural doesnt realize hes mocking 
 actual story involves carters investigation brother richies death 
hes town thats somehow local top dogs know well 
mickey rourke costars one characters sort crime boss something running porno web site blackmailing young internet tycoon played alan cummings looking acting lot like pee wee herman 
theres also another plot involving richies mistress secret cdrom convicting disturbing evidence something terrible involving one carters stillliving relatives 
im rolling eyes just thinking trying critique way remotely comprehendible 
 just rip screenplay shreds plus direction editing production values require discussion nearly every scene order explain 
 dont like put spoliers reviews either intentionally accidentally 
yes get carter just complicated complex 
 whats worse intricate make seem smart like usual suspects example just opposite 
 get feeling whoever wrote script short intervals spaced far apart probably didnt remember already happened didnt figure scene lead next one major plot points work towards climax 
 really need know film just scenes carter tracking one scumbag supposed witness another asking know getting information realizing wasnt complete idiot figured first five minutes 
although supporting characters equally stupid since tell everything comes back haunt one violent way another 
making movie entirely criminals doesnt necessarily mean unlikable cliche cutout characters 
mel gibson starred payback years ago story unlike one good screenplay couldnt help like even though just bad guy jack carter 
 ultimately get carter fails pretty much every selling point 
carter likable character really dont care gets revenge 
 action sequences exciting original 
 enemies massive conspiracy threatening cmon know whos going win every brawl shootout car chase 
 end dont feel nearly satisfied results 
 filmmakers good job everything unoriginal possible 
 city never mentioned name assume seattle since cars washington license plates always raining
