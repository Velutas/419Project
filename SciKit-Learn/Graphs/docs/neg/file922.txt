 highlyanticipated film rendition cult television show originally slotted early june opening gone headtohead rival studios heavy hitters eventual demotion less potent midaugust opening obvious early indication studios lack confidence picture 
 good reason 
 joyless exercise film held together barely coherent plot lacking semblance excitement thrills wit
