 knock exactly cheap knock action movie 
 also worst movie seen thus far year 
 figured least couple months saw worst film alas already found 
jeanclaude van damme stars think designer jeans executive discovers halfbrother supplying cheaper goods 
rob schneider plays van dammes partner rochon plays 
actually idea rochon supposed 
 just sort popped halfway without explanation 
many things explained film know bizarre reason van damme seemed jackie chan impression throughout flick 
 chan comes endearing normal guy character seen many films van damme just comes wimp 
 never given clear explanation basis many actions 
 clear even know supposed hour movie even made clear 
 film directed style strange film experiment gone horribly wrong 
tsui hark directed van dammes last movie bad nearly bad double team never lets camera rest second thats exaggeration 
 even treated five second shot point view van dammes foot entering shoe 
fabulous 
seriously though problem directors want play around film conventions long dont get carried away 
 example look sam raimi 
 army darkness one best movies features inventive camera work ever seen raimi never lets special effects get way story 
thats concept tsui cant seem grasp 
 special effects outrageous camera angles rule knock point audience doesnt clue whats happening 
another problem film looks cheap 
 film stock used low caliber thought watching one chinese films shown really late night 
 inexplicable reason everyones voice seems dubbed 
even stars 
 even special effects seemingly aspect film director actually cared inconsistent 
 example scene van damme drives car window 
 car slams ground left wheel completely destroyed 
seconds later car drives full speed 
hey problem suspending disbelief action movie line must drawn somewhere 
finally acting 
nobody gives good performance film 
van damme actor usually like way mark playing everyman 
 schneider provide comic relief assume totally unfunny acts way every scene 
even usually solid paul sorvino gives terribly overthetop performance 
 idea supposed 
 case havent yet made clear enough knock worst movie van dammes career possibly worst movie decade 
 even one movies thats bad funny 
 inept funny 
 redeeming factors knock seriously hope every print film burned crisp somehow memory watching film can erased
