 enduring mariah careys film debut glitter im reminded bit chris rocks bigger blacker 
 response women saying can raise child without man rock says can drive car feet dont mean done 
 say can give mariah carey movie certainly dont mean done 
sure plenty pop star film vehicles beatles hard days night spice girls spice world none vapidly pointless laughable glitter 
everything complete tripe ludicrous 
start story gruesomely predictable least offensive part movie 
 film inexplicably set s period piece really shows sign period except chicks leg warmers 
worse yet everyones speaking late s hiphop slang 
meant partially autobiographical carey plays billie frank young singer new york struggles overcome rough childhood abandonment alcoholic mother 
influential club dj julian dice k lucky max beesley playing bad mix puff daddy robert de niro hears sing track decides make star 
 predictably rapid succession billie dice fall starts hitting big dice gets jealous starts acting like ass suddenly billies roller coaster superstardom 
 meantime billie emotional hunt missing mom 
 wont give away ending honestly just think unicorns rainbows 
youll figure 
 movie screams made camp couldve fun 
 filmmakers thought making bulk glitter weepy dramatic better 
 mistake 
 brief attempts comic relief scene effeminate russiansounding director gets wacky filming billies first music video go like lead balloons 
instead audience screening tended laugh loudest mariahs dramatic scenes 
 brings us performances theres nothing good can said 
mariah primarily seen wideeyed deerintheheadlights look frozen face 
 actually looks scared one love scene 
 wonder writing isnt even worse 
 much dialogue hackneyed watered careys virginal target audience probably impossible actor pull aplomb 
even characters couldnt written absurdly 
theyre members barbie playset important film director swoons billie id love put movie im making bigtime record executive takes billies demo tape says oh ill make sure whole team listens morning 
everyone film device painful keep watching just see another one appear 
 say waste 
theres much wrong film 
 pains mariah carey ego sanity fragile condition days evidenced multiple hospital stays will suffer negative reviews shes likely get 
 suffer movie
