call hush stop mom will kill 
 mommy fearest 
 hand robs cradle 
call whatever want certainly dont see unless youre desperate need bad movieinduced chuckle hush scores many unintentional guffaws almost qualifies guilty pleasure 
chalk losses frequent stupidity lapses apparent postproduction tinkering supposed open year ago latter appears given hush sendoff thats downright infuriating 
 bad hush laughable onscreen talent including pairing gwyneth paltrow jessica lange nothing laugh 
paltrow johnathon schaech play helen jackson photogenic new york couple way spend christmas vacation wealthy welltodo familys horse farmestate kilronan 
jacksons mother martha lange runs kilronan genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately even first meeting martha takes place helen altogether caught redhanded bedroom romp husbandtobe 
 seems marthas friendly smile masks much threatening demeanor shes youd call someone loves much 
martha eagerly deviously wants grandchild helen will expendable far shes concerned 
 theres one reason catch hush lange 
 treats pedestrian screenplay better deserves treated injecting martha poorly written though may little empathy level psychoplaying field 
 delves marthas dark side predictable cliches chainsmoking staring mirrors praying confessional priest isnt poking hole helens diaphragm shell become pregnant abound moderately entertaining junk lange interesting actress watch 
veteran performer nina foch smart tart jacksons wheelchairbound paternal grandmother 
 rest cast looks ill uncomfortable especially paltrow 
 can really blame 
 character relationships hush hold certain amount promise least psychological impact blown water sheer stupidity 
idiotic situations martha yells nearby horse will bolt knock helen compliment idiotic dialogue yell 
helen yells back martha film takes form one shoddier fill blankfromhell flicks ever made 
 can see great deal marthas actions lies conception people known woman years longer never figure things 
 nobody communicate read newspaper town 
 potential victims thought acted behaved like normal people hush really short movie 
 theres climax ending abruptly come helen starts contractions eating pound cake spiked laborinducing drug normally used horses 
 really weird chase scene martha calmly knits rocking chair forcing helen give birth bed 
 wont spoil happens next except say contradictory illogical probably since im doctor medically impossible 
 final scene offers closure resolution confrontation whatsoever 
 just dangling amidst silent displeasure 
 one like ending regardless feelings preceding material 
perhaps hush s title plea silence audiences likely bitter word mouth exiting theater
