 obvious reason producing sequel immensely popular movie acquire continued profits 
 rationale sound many cases recent years sequel shoddy product thats exposed cashmilking vehicle really 
last years speed scream well years species ii products decisively less satisfactory 
 cases sequel can even discredit predecessor latest neoslasher flick still know last summer 
whatever uniqueness original mightve now seems trite overplayed paired abominable thriller

theres much thats original still know market saturated genx thrillers like one unlikely still know will get recognition bad sequel 
 diehard fans genre will required viewing material bottom line material just recycled original know last summer 
 aura thrillerism surrounding plot isnt heightened skillful scripting camera work rather tense stringbased score manipulative editing 
 man hook ends becoming belittled time around script gives many lines dialogue goes scary figure nutcase short painful moments

three four teens run automatically man rain slicker nonchalantly refer killer 
theyre almost used performances show hewitt prinze brandy phifer give decent show 
 end left wide open third movie likely brand new supporting cast
