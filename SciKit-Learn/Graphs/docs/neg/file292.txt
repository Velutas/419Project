movies can two big es well educate entertain 
 best possible worlds accomplish 
 red planet fail entirely 
 near future manned mission sent mars observe primitive plant growth 
 film remarkable job demonstrating exactly exciting watching algae grow 
 mumbojumbo ecological disaster earth interminable wait reach fourth planet ship falls apart almost fast movie 
 ground crew people couldnt care less trapped surface without food water air stalked deadly rogue cyberdog 
 one potentially interesting character carrieanne moss spends time alone orbiting ship talking computer 
attempting graft esque space mysticism terminator robot horror first time director antony hoffman cant seem figure whats going 
neither can 
didnt anyone step back shooting make sure coherent story 
couldnt used money saved pay half dozen actors hire scriptwriter 
 many missteps 
every opportunity create dynamic tension thwarted plot holes lackluster direction 
 introduce theme faith vs science crewman comment disappears early die offscreen 
 audience begins film waiting something happen 
two hours later theyre still waiting 
despite greatest hopes life red planet
