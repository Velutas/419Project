 scene movie jennifer aniston waist wearing bra 
 made chuckle time movie actually wears one 
 enough cleavage movie satisfy russ meyer 
 like director said well know story formulaic performances arent great heck lets show jennifers assets often uncovered humanly possible keep pg rating 
quite frankly insulting 
 dont think aniston competent enough actress carry movie 
 decent enough job ed burns shes one smaller supporting role just doesnt deliver goods effectively movie 
 performance convincing 
unfortunately far romantic comedies go movie adds nothing new standard formula types movies 
 film similar best friends wedding sense leading female character actually quite vindictive due actions gets sympathy things go awry 
 didnt care quickly kate puts nicks profession explaining videotaping weddings wasnt glamorous enough coworkers 
 least best friends wedding changed formula bit somewhat surprise ending 
 luck picture perfect 
every plot occurrence can spotted mile away including couple really made sense 
 everything kate done prove loyalty company blindly throw away made sure nick even talk first let alone consider relationship 
 quitting job prerequisite making amends nick 
throw fact dont think nick kate spent enough time together even warrant rash decision 
 believe kate liked liked intensely willing throw career away 
 doubt 
 ending scene wedding entire congregation feels necessary stop everything stare couple 
 mass groups people simultaneously interested total strangers 
well guess congregation consists movie extras strangers movies two lead stars make sense 
picture perfect directed glenn gordon caron
