well get idea 
just add action theres also viking vs viking duel 
 movies insert scenes fights scenes called character development 
 suspect th warrior better script one time fell cracks tagteam direction 
 movie started hands john mctiernan youll notice lot similarities warrior mctiernans predator including chittering jungle sounds 
somewhere along line mctiernan bailed michael crichton took 
crichton whose novel eaters dead basis warrior directed small assortment goofy sciencefiction thrillers westworld coma looker runaway 
 result consecutive efforts murky pointless movie 
perhaps th warrior needs anything else villain 
 eaters dead faceless mob blackface 
 personality end dont even seem particularly threatening 
 audience target toward channel aggression 
mctiernan know importance interesting villain die hard made villains seem fun attracted bigname stars evil roles action films 
 th warrior suffers lack vision 
 wants predator meets braveheart meets magnificent seven meets dances wolves 
 many competing goals can echo might 
 might satisfying action film 
 might beautifullyrendered medieval epic 
 might thoughtprovoking examination meeting cultures 
 shame turned nothing particular 
bottom line want see antonio swing sword rent mask zorro
