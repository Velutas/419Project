 attempt florida film noir palmetto fails fundamental levels 
 slow moving uninvolving plain just uninteresting 
harry barber woody harrelson exnewspaper man just jail framed crime 
 luck hasnt best things looking mysterious woman rhea malroux elisabeth shue approaches proposition 
 wants harry help stepdaughter odette chloe sevigny pull fake kidnapping scheme get stingy rich husband felix rolf hoppe 
 first harry expected provide threatening voice phone collect money gets keep 
 deed carried things seem harry gets caught ensuing storm 
palmetto pulls stops achieve film noir film effect never quite comes together 
 got sultry florida heat seductive women even curvier plot twists whole thing smells paintbynumbers 
sure right ingredients end result much artificial 
 lot problems lie script though providing genuine surprises packed full leaden dialogue bland situations 
even plot twists dont seem flow well rest story 
 example come far afield seemingly make sense writer needed twist example harrys spontaneous job offer whole typewriter situation 
 characters mostly lifeless played type much 
woody harrelson plays harry imbecilic thickheadedness hard even picture exjournalist 
elisabeth shue vamps doesnt add anything special role 
chloe sevigny gives terrible performance trying sexy year old just leaves bad taste mouth 
 supporting cast notably gina gershon michael rapaport give stronger end meaningless performances 
 top pacing film much slow 
 movie grinds halt youre given much time wonder youre wasting watching palmetto 
 youre mood type movie youd much better going renting classic film noir
