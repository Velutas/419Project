staring george clooney arnold schwarzenegger chris odonnell uma thurman alicia silverstone 
well start id just like say couple things 
first miss michael keaton miss tim burton much prefer think last two batman films like dallas dream sequence 
 even first film batman really star though damn close first couple anyway 
 batman forever now batman robin hes almost pushed bit player 
 cant really say clooney regardless better kilmer good batman 
hes given next nothing might well wouldnt made much difference 
now joel schumacher said refuses bend masses hated films cheered return buton wont make batman brooding dark 
fine mean granted batman returns awsome film bit dark sometimes 
yet bright neon campy style just killing anything series meant 
im usually easy films 
 loved con air films critics slammed 
granted film really paper thin cliche ridden except one thing fun 
 virtually fun film 
 couldnt cared less 
itll thrill little ones theres violence really none everyone comes fine end like old tv shows ends everyone laughing 
schwarzenegger awful mean really really bad 
 coming regular fan work 
 love movies time basic reason never says much 
 talks often movie 
 much prefered seen patric stewart roll 
 believe truely like film care least someone film 
 liked alfred reason behind cheap shot
