 indeed plusses 
 fairness elizabeth berkley certainly worth seeing buff 
 ability whine irritate us even nude appropriate role selfish temptress nomi malone 
 character smart interesting deliberately 
far annoying far often 
like s bulworth movie didnt care one little iota main character 
 least warren beatty tried make statement dreary overrated film though 
 showgirls stupid make statement 
 people claim story based legendary eve things 
 exploitation expert joe eszterhas half screenwriter joseph l mankiewicz hed well

instead project may sunk career 
 wrote ha ha 
script usually reliable paul verhoeven directed 
 team created good sexfilm basic instinct struck occasional violence gratuitous xrated sex scenes numerous quite unnecessary lesbian overtones 
 predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking las vegas make big dancer 
 supposed streetsmart young lady gets conned suitcase slackjawed yokel opening sequence befriends tailor glamorous stage production stardust hotel 
nomi doesnt take advantage contact break bigtime dirty dancing right away 
first becomes lap dancer scummy strip club 
 sells hot little wares cheetah short time turning fictitious customers actual theatre audience 
hey never said wasnt hot number 
maybe body gets bigtime star stardust hotel crystal connors gina gershon stops strip club certainly isnt brains pleasant disposition 
crystal requests private lap dance boyfriend kyle maclachlan

 subplot male dancer glenn plummer claims see talent nomi just gratuitous opportunity let dance naked little bit 
 sure aint character development 
plummer also appeared speed smaller yet better role 
 subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe deliver unsubtle hint fornicators practice birth control 
kyle maclachlan must promised big payday standards dipped since appearing blue velvet 
 picture weird critics claim one best movies s

ultimately movie tiresome explicit 
everyone must know now softcore acts copulation especially riotous romp berkley maclachlan pool 
 reviewers take issue meanspirited movie 
everyones either sex exacting revenge wishing sex exacting revenge 
 just hard take especially two hours 
 must exposed evils vegas world couldnt verhoeven also made point highlighting whispers grunts sounds dance numbers 
 hard care people cant even appreciate theyre capable onstage
