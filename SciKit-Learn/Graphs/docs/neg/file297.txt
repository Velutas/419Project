everyone knows old rule never work children animals 
 latest horror flick mimic case never work children genetically enhanced killer animals instead mimic features succeeds nothing except mildly engaging audience 
 film begins new york see children dying mysterious disease carried cockroaches 
dr susan tyler sorvino creates genetically enhanced bug judas breed however designed kill cockroaches 
 bug job cockroaches die terror gone 
three years later appears screen discover judas breed back bigger ever ready kill 
 spin bug however can mimic predator case 
humans 
 teach us squishing bugs 
 roller coaster ride bugs everywhere tons gory deaths massive set pieces instead turns rather subdued almost boring movie plods along slow pace 
perhaps movie trying thought provoking trying avoid predator type movie easily become 
 director writers made wrong move perfectly suited action fest 
 director bought us cronos far superior film directs film calm frankly dull movie 
 exciting sequences instead just lot people talking 
 dialogue intelligent right sadly babbling nonsense 
 fact script embarrsingly weak characterizations much better sorvino company d characters come script bothering develop 
 action film directed annoying way just infuriating watch 
 camera cuts place disoreitating audience instead involving audience action merely alienates 
 peformances o k slightly average 
sorvino o k although shes good conveying terror anything emotion really 
 supporting cast sterotypes characters big black security guard foul mouth geeky scientist spectacles stereotypical mexican old timer ever 
 reasonable good fun however 
mimic may fail story pacing characters film look good 
like dark city mimic definite case style content 
 may bit gloomy good sets look nice parts film directed well 
 looks arent good enough save mimic depths mediocre somewhere shouldnt really belong 
 good opportunity wasted 
 shame 
overall rating review david wilcock
