 great anticipation sat view braveheart last week premiered american cable 
 academy award winning film highly acclaimed 
 also featured music one favorite film composers james horner 
 disappointing overlong film anything best picture 
 drags braveheart screenplay 
 abounds high production values john tolls awardwinning cinematography also graced edward zwicks legends fall gorgeous score horner sort logistics make wish assistant directors household names 
 save misguided script 
 film wishes paint central character hero viewers response heroism intellectual william wallace producerdirector mel gibson fighting freedom tyranny root 
 wallaces actions paint different story 
 speaks freedom acts vengeance 
though one intellectually realizes wallace right side film paints unconvincing emotional portait wallace just bad english king 
wallace speaks freedom acts point toward vengeance 
 kicking english scotland decides invade england 
 evident spartacus complex example applies historically cinematically 
 historical spartacus one point moved liberating slaves sacking roman cities film spartacus like braveheart high production values competent performaces dragged awful screenplay 
 shame excellent score part terrible film 
horners score tries make emotional connection performances script help 
gibson portrays wallace way audience relate identify 
 drags emotional connection films plot turns three hours total waste time
