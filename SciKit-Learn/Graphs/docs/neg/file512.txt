 years ago national lampoon introduced us new family griswolds 
 griswolds embarked crosscountry journey destination wally world worldrenowned theme park california 
 laughed heads shared wild crazy mishaps family endured 
two years later watched went europe four years shared christmas 
now eight years passed laughs done die 
theyve cremated 
vegas vacation brings back chevy chase clark griswold good intentioned illfated father two 
 premise basically 
clark wonderful idea take family bonding vacation time las vegas 
 wife ellen beverly dangelo teenage kids rusty audrey always played different actors time around ethan embry marisol nichols respectively join soon find sin city casinos will make backdrop ninety minutes slapstick 
 course vacation movie wouldnt complete without good ole eddie reprised randy quaid misfit cousin showing wrong times 
 isnt much plot comes right 
 really just skit movie 
 couple ways define skit movie real term far know 
 first movie basically one running gag two hours therefore coming like two hour skit 
 second movie seems comprised twenty shorter skits lasting five minutes 
vegas vacation comes like first 
 good example latter last years black sheep 
 problem format becomes old fast doesnt really fit movie mold 
 cases plot generally thin used either shameless filler scenes simply add convenience gags e 
 good vegas joke make vegas movie 
 case movies miniplots 
clark gets gambling fever begins spending griswolds money ellen verge affair wayne newton rusty fake id using gambling advantage audrey desperate fun winds joining cousin vickie shae dlyn exotic dancer 
 simple fact movie isnt funny 
 first find chuckling heartily couple little jokes movie got rolling interest suddenly stopped 
chase plays clark griswold really well 
 made character character 
dangelo quite honest never impressive ellen movie doesnt show signs redemption 
 two new griswold kids word blah comes mind 
 vacation series seems prove anybody can play two characters simple reason nothing 
theyre generic youll expect credits read girl audrey griswold 
vegas vacation differs first three series just laugh factor 
yes true vegas vacation isnt even close close funny others actually pretty fun doofy ways couple things set one negatively apart 
first leave national lampoons heading title 
 couldnt find reasons maybe fact even national lampoon didnt want associated lame film 
thats saying lot especially look else company proudly presented loaded weapon pcu etc expected another hit assume theyd proud tack notorious header reasons can guess like movie sucking didnt 
 another difference makes obvious impact 
 first three films vacation series written john hughes talented writer behind several popular films s including mr 
mom sixteen candles breakfast club weird science pretty pink ferris buellers day planes trains automobiles uncle buck 
wowzers 
 r sum 
looking names youd think guy wrote everything now stands movie icon s 
well thats 
 guy also brought us s hits including home alone series remake dalmatians dennis menace current flubber 
vegas vacation however didnt john hughes behind loss obvious 
 time around script hands elisa bell whose credits thus far include four madefortv movies 
vegas vacation plays much like one actually work much better madefortv sequel 
 sounds like wild idea 
revenge nerds third fourth installments television movies seemed like 
vegas vacation fit well fox network m 
sunday morning movie silver screen major motion picture quite place 
stephen kesslers jejune direction doesnt help things either 
 makes film even tvmovieish 
 consecutive vacation movie suffered drop directing power 
 started series harold ramis also directed caddyshack groundhog day well cowriting ghostbusters 
 bad 
 national lampoons european vacation directed amy heckerling go direct hits look whos talking clueless well already directed infamous fast times ridgemont high 
lastly national lampoons christmas vacation directed jeremiah s chechik went direct charming benny joon 
kessler far one title belt short film birch street gym received oscar nomination 
granted first attempt feature length film can allow amateurish quality instead get movie straight text book boring bland deeply unoriginal 
 loved vacation movies know us still isnt anything worth seeing 
 loved dont ruin good impressions series indulging tragic example cinema ala carte 
 never like series need confirm
