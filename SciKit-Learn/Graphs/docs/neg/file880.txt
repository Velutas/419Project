 return horror high wants couple different types movies 
 film tells story lowbudget horror movie filmed closeddown crippen high school group serial murders took place five years 
 cast crew dont know real killer maybe one never apprehended going action 
 one level return horror high slasher movie level works best 
watching film made couldnt help take notice killers costume almost identital ghostface scream scream 
 another level film wants slapstick comedy many hints throughout 
unfortunately jokes fall flat 
 last thing film wants behindthescenes look exploitation film made 
 problem much supposed movie made cameras shown filming thus making far confusing 
 top twist ending makes little sense whatsoever basically left feeling wasted time 
 story developments beyond ludicrous plot holes drive winnebago 
 see film seen youll know mean 
 premise return horror high admittedly pretty crafty liked atmosphere school whole thing takes place 
 director froehlich judging movie incompetent director except able film seldom suspeneful scene 
well come think one scene actually scary two actors locked room killer tries break 
 twominute distraction return horror high certainly great shake 
note look george clooney supporting role one actors film 
 strangely enough first character get ax literally
