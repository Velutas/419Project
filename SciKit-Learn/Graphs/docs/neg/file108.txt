 following review contains spoilers 
 just 
 way 
 
 rapist matt frewer responds supergirls helen slater query shes attacked example mindnumbingly bad dialogue supergirl 
ill admit 
 love superman iii 
 know hated amongst superman faithful dismiss nothing vehicle richard pryor still think worthy addition man steel franchise 
supergirl spinoff film sorts series producers alexander ilya salkind doesnt even rival superman iii terms quality let alone superman superman ii 
supergirl lost opening scenes went steadily downhill rest two hour plus running time 
 film begins see residents argo city commune like place consisting refugees krypton resides inner space go daily lives 
ok 
 
 exiles krypton blew right 
 living krypton exploded 
 get inner space 
 whole inner space notion never explained particularly terms people get information outside world 
 know superman went 
 know took name clark kent now works daily planet 
 kinds things frustrate hell 
argo city kept running power source called omegahedron 
one day founder argo city zaltar peter o toole gives omegahedron supermans cousin kara helen slater use inspiration art 
kara uses create buglike thing immediately crashes layer whatever protects city 
 chaos omegahedron sails opening dooming argonians death 
 three days time something 
kara climbs pod zaltar designed interdimensional travel chases omegahedron save world 
 power source travels directly earth lands bowl dip belonging minorleague witch named selena faye dunaway immediately dip ruined announced desires rule world sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook 
selena somehow knows ball sky will help evil plans sets achieve world domination 
selena unaware course kara also arrived earth shes arrived supergirl complete appropriate costume 
supergirl emerges bottom lake arrives 
ok 
huh 
 omegahedron fall sky supergirl shoots bottom lake 
attention movie explain 
im sorry can suspend disbelief much 
 cant buy nonsense just movie wants 
knowing needs secret identity supergirl basically wills school girl outfit complete different hairstyle picks alias linda lee enrolls school 
shes given dorm assignment happens roommate 
lois lanes sister lucy 
ok coincidence one thing folks getting really contrived now 
 follows generic allgirls school hijinks 
complete evil bully girls mean reason course even shower scene 
best moment though comes supergirl decides put bra school uniform starts stuffing socks 
 point im rapidly wondering im bothering nonsense 
 credit give film however 
one lengthy elaborate sequence featuring evil bulldozer destroying small town search prey well done 
also commendable see genders reversed film whereas women power men merely objects tools 
hart bochner die hard particularly fun karas love interest lovesick landscaper spell cast selena although unfortunately part one films ridiculous moments rescued tapped menacing bumper cars 
 numerous little things bothered 
 flying effects never convincing moment 
 obvious helen slater hooked wires 
instead look like shes flying filmmakers wanted graceful poses lot ballettype maneuvers 
also first two humans meet supergirl arrives earth 
 pair truck driversrapists immediately attack meet wacky demise 
 also rampant product placement film notably popeyes tylenol aw root beer latter actually putting logo tshirt one rapists 
finally just one word monsters 
faye dunaway peter otoole ham unmercifully however otoole overacts hes entertaining dunaway shes annoying character actually says line seize 
 one point 
dunaways henchmen played peter cook brenda vaccaro fare much better vaccaro coming best equivalent ned beattys otis character first two superman movies 
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl innocent naive character shes written shes able gaze flowers bunnies right amount genuine wonder make believable 
believability aside though still annoying 
now despite negativity im alone supergirl well liked well respected movie many circles leave good people anchor bay entertainment actually make people interested excited release dvd 
 released two separate editions film dvd delight many people including 
yet im still unclear since movie awful 
 first widely available dvd release features international version film runs minutes longer print ran u s theaters 
 movie presented original theatrical aspect ratio enhanced x televisions remastered full thx glory 
extras disc include full length audio commentary track director jeannot szwarc special project consultant scott michael bosco excellent minute documentary called supergirlthe making feature dig workout montage trailers tv spots talent bios indepth storyboards accompanied score movie assorted still galleries 
 transfer international version incredible 
youd think watching new release 
images sharp colors jump screen picture free scratches artifacts 
 special effects sequences show wear time just isnt much can done unless youre obsessive like george lucas 
 new thx approved audio loud clear right places however youll hearing absurd dialogue mediocre jerry goldsmith score completely unrelated john williams classic superman theme sounds better suited cannon films golanglobus production 
 commentary track featuring director szwarc project consultant bosco step right direction evolution audio commentaries 
bosco seems expert things supergirl szwarc ensure theres dead air track 
bosco probes szwarc information virtually everyone everything comes onscreen learn great deal film result participation 
although times can tell bosco looking specific response szwarc surprised doesnt get response 
 learn fascinating tidbits track notably almost appearance film christopher reeve 
great detail given supermans proposed role original script reeve wisely dropped 
 stands superman written early film hear radio broadcast mention billions light years away sort peace mission 
 sake brevity wont even get one 
szwarc also reveals conscious decision salkinds everyone else agreed supergirl needed stand replacing science fiction superman films cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense 
bosco also points scenes american release come along claiming original release hit box office 
 sake brevity wont even get one 
anchor bay also released limited edition copies pressed twodisc set 
disc one contains everything mentioned regular release 
disc two features never seen directors cut film runs minutes long 
 additions mainly consist scene extensions dont add much note except moments lengthen peter otooles screen time particularly latter appearances 
 print rough spots sound mono fans film wont care 
one question though 
shouldnt directors commentary directors cut film 
id never seen supergirl sat watch dvd 
 nine released theaters even smart enough inform parents take see 
 popped dvd player sat easy chair idea expect 
 knew film wasnt beloved never interest willing give shot impressive amount work put disc 
 disc began spin rather impressed opening sequence made sit wonder assumptions time wrong 
come find however just chase digital stereo logo 
 slunk back seat nightmare started 
 end film supergirl flies back lake omegahedron flies back argo city 
ugh give 
im surprised even made end film twice three times review discs 
supergirl definitely terrific dvd package lousy movie
