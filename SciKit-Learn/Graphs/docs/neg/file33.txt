 talents jackie chan rush hour chow yunfat anna king corrupter yuen wooping matrix moved budget bloated world hollywood filmmaking mixed results 
now can add two hong kong filmmakers mix star jet li director fight choreographer corey yuen kwai

escaping u s han sets find person responsible brothers death 
 romeo must die many ways fun film 
 absurd assured 
 basic plot gangster wanting become legitimate echoes godfather 
 relationship jet lis han aaliyahs trish oday reminds us abel ferreras china girl except romeo must dies couple never exchange loving glance towards one another 
 romance much puritanical romance film history 
 performances adequate fully acceptable 
li course showiest part express innocents steadfast determination 
allayah feature film debut manages carry little asked certain style grace 
 obvious camera loves photogenic 
 still part written way even poor performance affected 
delro lindo issac oday carries well film 
 unsung appreciated actor mr lindo turns films best performance 
 performers adequate script asks except d b woodside issacs son colin 
 performance undirected character changing tone demeanor accordance whatever location 
 unfocused performance reigned better written 
first time director andrzej bartkowiak workmanlike job handling film 
 career one industrys best cinematographers bartkiwiak knows set shots romeo must die look good 
 pacing film lethargic coming semblance life fight scenes 
 script eric bernt john jarrell focused way can care characters situations 
 big gambit buying waterfront property facilitate building sports center nfl team needlessly confusing 
 course common practice one character comic relief film becomes painfully obvious anthony anderson allayahs bodyguard maurice comic timing whatsoever 
 best things film fight scenes 
jet li master intricate physical battles 
one needs see film fist legend understand man without peer realm martial art combat 
 jet given opportunity show way lethal weapon jets u s debut didnt allow 
unfortunately lot jets fights aided computer effects detract ability precision 
also romeo must die must noted singularly useless effect ever committed film xray effect appears three times course film showing effect bone crushing blows opponent 
obviously homage famed xray scene sonny chibas streetfighter scenes just pointless interfere pacing film 
 film stopped video game inserted 
one problem though fight scenes 
 familiar hong kong action know even though films fantasies removed reality anime cartoon 
 internal rhythm 
 heartbeat speak choreography 
 fight scenes hong kong film breath emotional resonance 
 created performance direction editing 
 romeo must die staccato 
every fight scene even though technically adroit amazing becomes boring editing cuts away battle hand simple follows set pattern 
 rhythm monotonous 
 hong kong film tempo changes heightening emotional impact 
rmd limited standard tempo allowing emotional content whatsoever 
 fine example difference can found examining couple jackie chans films 
watch restaurant fight film rush hour notice context fight technically amazing rather flat framing cut always help 
now look warehouse fight rumble bronx 
 heartbeat emotional draw doesnt let audience catch breath 
 stops pauses dramatic effect work perfectly causing viewer astounded flabbergasted 
 romeo must die fight scenes emotional content character john wayne barroom brawl 
jet li grand personable screen presence 
 shame full talents used full effect 
one day filmmakers u s will stop making films numbers start embrace style emotion made hong kong action pictures commodity 
 well left emotionally hollow product like replacement killer currently romeo must die
