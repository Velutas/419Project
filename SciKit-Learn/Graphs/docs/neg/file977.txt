nostalgia s continues see revival one decades greatest achievements marijuana comedy 
however half baked doesnt quite run brain cells will make appreciate questionable talents cheech chong

 comedy film pretty humorless 
 doesnt try 
just comic setups obvious payoffs nearly fall flat 
 four leads nearly playing character 
 williams stands still performing level humorfree comedy rocket man hes imprisoned throughout film giving much needed change pace mostly swapping one set obvious gags another 
 help film packed full cameos 
steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg jon stewart make appearances one point another 
none work beyond simple hey thats level 
 fact funniest work film comes chappelle 
 bland pothead lead second role potobsessed rapper sir smokealot 
granted pretty much onejoke role arent ton laughs film needs every one can scrape 
 top move contrasting tone rest film thurgood given love interest mary jane rachel true 
 role public service announcement inform us drugs including pot wrong 
 character seems fabricated merely defense film promotes use drugs camp 
 film better sticking rebel tone eagerly tries claim 
yet end doesnt really matter 
watching film clean sober bound recognize truly awful
