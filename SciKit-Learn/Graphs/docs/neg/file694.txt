 nothing unabashedly romantic films 
 done right least slightly evident restraint can engaging sweeping appealing 
 hell shame someone botches badly nora ephron botched sleepless seattle hollow boring romance appeal gullible viewers ones willing buy ephrons whiny views life romance 
tom hanks meg ryan two hollywoods likeable stars play sam baldwin annie reed repectively 
baldwins wife recently died moved seattle son jonah seeking get away familiar surroundings remind late spouse 
jonah senses tension calls talk radio show tell world problems 
sam seems ready strangle son calling show gets phone begins pouring heart 
ephron annie reed meg ryan can hear 
annie happy woman 
 engaged walter allergyprone working man seems perfectly content 
 hearing sam widower radio show becomes convinced destiny willing risk engagement 
five years movie hit theaters hanks ryan ephron team far better although still subpar romantic comedy youve got mail people hate real life falling love internet 
 least movie sense spontaneity

 fact sam annie will finally meet excruciatingly obvious everything else perfunctory 
sleepless seattle full wonderful performers two leads supporting stars like bill pullman rosie odonnell 
 none can save film bore 
 characters dull empty script isnt funny particularly charming 
 script fundamental problem annie gives little reason life walter pursue sleepless seattle never even seen 
 kind life decision real people dont make major unforgivable plausibility sacrifice 
 essence movies purpose head towards goal shouldnt even exist 
 ten minute short film ninetyfive minutes filler 
 show sleepless seattle didnt review just call asleep philadelphia
