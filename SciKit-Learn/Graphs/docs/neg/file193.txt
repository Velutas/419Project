poster boy codependency needs patching 
patch adams film review michael redman copyright michael redman 
mediocrity pox civilization 
 heavily consumer oriented society enormous demand churn stuff 
 happen economy didnt feel need things 
 make us buy businesses need produce ton product 
 sheer volume items necessitates dubious quality 
 film industry like 
 order studios survive make money 
 prevailing attitude films equal profit 
 movies obviously exist put wares screen less talented people used 
 arent enough great directors actors create number films necessary 
 reason never crossed anyones mind real equation quality films profit 
often mediocre films pain audience horrendous ones 
 can good time making fun bad movies 
im suggesting patch adams tossed just rake bucks 
 guess someone asleep wheel 
 features accomplished actor potentially engrossing story dull 
hunter patch adams robin williams desire become doctor unusual genesis 
checking mental institute suicide attempt discovers can help patients clowning around 
patch poster boy codependency 
 explains likes devoting others doesnt focus problems 
 decides wants physician leaves place couple years later enrolls medical college virginia 
 med student patchs antics schools hospital catch attention soon archenemy straightlaced dean walcott bob gunton 
 dean opposed goofiness wants patch kicked school although hes one top students 
 writes patchs academic file shows excessive happiness 
 walked film knowing little history wondered odd mechanical pacing 
 also seemed reason set early seventies 
 struck 
 must based true story 
 movie adaptation book hunter adams founded gesundheit institute free clinic 
robin williams amazing actor 
 adept dramatic roles forte overthetop free spirits 
thats makes failure remarkable 
patch exactly character best yet even scene another mental patient battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat 
something holds back 
 rest cast twodimensional 
 film champions seeing patients human beings curious ones cardboard characters 
peter coyote man dying cancer refreshing seems like real person 
unfortunately hes film two minutes 
 audience blatantly lead ring nose scene scene 
 left emotional decisions hit head 
shavedheaded children cancer elderly woman patch makes laugh beautiful woman cant love abusive history 
 group students fix old house use clinic andy hardy hey lets put play 
 can use barn mom can make curtains 
mode laugh roll around painting 
 might well giant signs flashing feel good now 
 feel bad now 
 patch good title film 
 patchwork every manipulative scene can think 
 fulloflife student fights stodgy establishment types 
theres touching death 
 theres another 
 film doesnt trust us get first time 
 dean tries kick patch later tries 
worst final courtroom bit 
scarylooking old men sit judgment man wants help people 
 room packed patchs supporters 
williams makes supposedly impassioned speech humanity 
 much emotion earlier statement humans animal kills members species contains truth 
 blame must placed director tom shadyac screenwriter steve oedekerk 
shadyac also directed first ace ventura movie 
oedekerk directed second one 
need say 
 real adams admired devotion treating patients people rather diseases 
 film number worthy messages state modern medical business hmos managed care 
 doctors gods theme will resonate number people poorly produced one will care
