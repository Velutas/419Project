 anything stigmata taken warning releasing similarlythemed films relatively close one another 
 four supernatural horror flicks released year clearly worst 
 suppose seen coming 
 blair witch thoroughly creeped sixth sense mildly spooky stir echoes moments wasnt anything id lose sleep 
clearly quality horror summer slowly dropping 
 surprise stigmata dullest horribly executed piece mtvinfluenced tripe seen long 
 really 
patricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser pittsburgh receives rosary gift globetrotting mother 
 turns rosary belonged recentlydeceased brazilian priest 
 priests church investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne mysterious appearance bleeding statue 
father kiernan investigator made career disproving supposed religious signs time believes something bleeding statue 
 investigation soon called however frankie starts exhibiting signs stigmata person inflicted wounds like jesus christ 
father kiernan initially skeptical frankie s story considering shes atheist witnesses stigmata attacks dedicates finding going 
 eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something bring catholic church 
 turns dead priest working translation fifth gospel excommunicated 
 new rupert wainwright music video 
 
 
 mean film stigmata sort film starts ok gets worse 
indeed good music video interesting five minutes 
im sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slowmotion doubleexposure extreme closeups whoaaaaaa fact swelled head director hollywood yes film school 
 camera trickery interesting little eventually becomes headacheinducing 
 film needed second audio track played dialogue wainwright screaming audience see 
look can 
im excellent director 
maybe hed explain decided start half scenes slowmotion shots water dripping reverse included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary 
 underlying meaning behind camera trickery didnt see 
just thought safe get involved story comes doubleexposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing bed reason whatsoever 
arrrrrrrghhhh 
 
 
 superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother stigmata story characters remotely engaging 
though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help seem given nearly unworkable script 
 plot continuity character development need 
case point frankie page character assume supposed identify sympathize arent given back story character reason like 
 extent character development seems hardworking hairdresser can somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building shes kind cute lets start bleeding 
 fact shes clearly brightest bulb drawer doesnt help either 
according frankie page first thing receiving mysterious wounds wrists back 
go clubbing 
sure makes sense 
arquette byrne pryce give old college try characters onedimensional just appear sleepwalking 
scenes arquette byrne probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable 
even though frankie pages life falling apart eyes still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon 
even curiously seems interested advances 
father andrews religious doubt pops suddenly seems silly dramatic 
 pryce may well wear curled mustache cackle ill get pretty depth cardinal houseman afforded 
trust im revealing anything telling pryce turns villain 
whats worse faced dull characters prospect annoying camera tricks loud music jammed throats now contend story starts one direction veers another another ends totally incomprehensible 
first film doesnt even bother explain simple plot details frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary 
 come atheist like chosen since father andrew mentions devout believers ever received stigmata 
actually im sure frankie posessed 
supposedly stigmata occurs one posessed holy spirit film later posessed dead priest later evil spirit think 
 one 
 answer question course simple possessing entity scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time 
furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrapup filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe catholic church 
 research gospel st thomas youll find suppressed church film seems claim readily available local library 
theres nothing catholics need worry though 
 stigmatas religion offbase cant confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church 
 wanted portray catholic priests mobsters gone allout equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns far interesting 
im catholic fact don t care much catholic church cartoonish misrepresentation film considered realistic means 
 rare see film fails many levels stigmata 
 s thoughtprovoking though like definitely scary though pretends 
im sure tried pass horror film absolutely nothing scary story 
maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight whatsoever 
 initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens 
like many films mtv generation one suffers overkill 
 much overdone stigmata eventually effect audience leaving us pick films many flaws 
im also still trying figure quotation take gospel st thomas earthshattering 
 finally hear saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns first day sunday school means flash whole film really much ado nothing 
 dog days summer usually produce one monstrous dog stigmata
