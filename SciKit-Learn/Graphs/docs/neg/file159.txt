 youre kind person goes see movies just long overpriced theatre popcorn butter optional movie 
indeed got either one unimaginative ripoffs recent action movies incredibly unfunny spoof 
 difficult fathom insipidness unless actually watch film 
 least warned quickly may regret ticket purchase giving us opportunity sneak adjacent show 
 four ingredients really bad action movie 
first movie gives us introductory premise 
huge caverns exist deep beneath ocean floor area many ships disappeared 
oooh scary 
secondly cheesy soundtrack tries connote tone mystery succeeds drowning ears abrasive musical score 
third main character mercenary delivers goods without asking contents cargo treat williams 
 operates sophisticated militarystyle pt boat every word comes mouth awash comical flippancy 
finally cargo hold see hired 
 also mercenaries toughlooking haircuts talk accents try show macho 
 trip across stormy sea boat suffers incident requires repairs 
spotting cruise ship distance make way ocean liner devise plan raid machine shop take parts need continue merry way 
little know cruise ship become infested kind ocean monster 
yet board ship armed hilt grenades machine guns can kill dozens matter seconds 
 nothing bythebook action film 
 realization situation theyre doesnt happen bowels boat 
 dumb enough stray will ultimately get killed 
 corridors ship narrow misty provide kind atmosphere scarefests must 
yet despite predictable nature film scary boo moments 
 just outright silly 
 film unusually gory 
monsters basically suck flesh spit skeletal remains 
 one particularly neat scene monster cut apart reveals victim still alive 
 screams horribly monsters digestive juices continue slowly eat away 
additionally borrows heavily speed alien bunch recent films 
 mercenaries even run lone surviving passenger femke jannsen looks amazingly like sandra bullock 
 honest left theatre just laugh witless film 
 moronic fun best 
 youre hankering large bucket popcorn served side silliness might just hit spot
