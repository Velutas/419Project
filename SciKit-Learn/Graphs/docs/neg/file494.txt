 sum entire film one sentence watch vh documentary instead 
 seems like someone brought william faulkner brought studio got really drunk told write dumbed released public 
 sloppy version almost stream conciousness spirals oblivion illusion sex drugs disco 
 narrator shane oshae ryan phillippe works grease monkey new jersey course whim decides go new york try get studio 
phillippe gives passable performance made young attractive actor six pack stomach 
 let steve rubbell mike myers infamous coowner studio attractive 
 eventually becomes bus boy bartender 
 
 
 expected didnt 
 isnt 
 film builds nothing becomes nothing climax isnt apt word studio lands thud 
 glitz club perpetually semiclothed patrons used attempt show glamour 
 much target audience college age early thirties attempts show celebrities mixing normal people 
 even fails since two celebs truly introduced andy warhol truman capote 
 can sure half audience hasnt heard another quarter know names quarter knew already 
 humor can call built eighty year old woman getting high s references like john travolta olivia newton john making us laugh stupid back 
 best performance film given mike myers perpetually high sexually ambivlaent new york steve rubell 
 seems play rubell better rubell still alive 
 looks like rubell sounds just like giving subdued almost nostalgic performance needed 
 reminds saturday night live character linda richmond coffee talk sans dress wig 
 supporting cast salma hayek breckin meyer neve cambell give added subplots introduced lead absolutely nowhere 
 romance phillippe cambell soap opera star completely implausable 
 two share half much screen time shots eighty year old hooked amphetimenes 
hayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced husband greg meyer stands shane oshaes surrogate best friend 
 subplots seemed forced seem like added just make sure film hour half long 
overall tried give view brashness place crack flowed like heroin flowed like wine 
 film never leads anything obserable point covers lack real plot veil beautiful people 
 truth reminded eighies
