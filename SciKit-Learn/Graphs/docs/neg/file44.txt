 party camp one mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen awhile 
 late ripoff meatballs series film follows group young camp counselors camp chipmunk 
thats really can said plot nothing much happens except main character wisecracking jerry andrew ross hots cute blonde kerry brennan big contest climax 
 fun 
since party camp practically screenplay talent involved least makers done make raunchy exploitative 
 think exploitation necessarily good quality talking dull turkey like least done fill lot mindless sex 
even psychopathic slasher camp done trick 
 least wouldnt chore sit 
never seen many jokes fall astoundingly flat 
 comedy easy spot wasnt least bit funny 
 groaninducing 
constantly throghout asking director gary graver actually thought movie worth anything 
 saves party camp dreaded zero star rating 
well thats simple jewel shepard flighty bimbo admittedly fun watch 
although nothing saved film lowest depths motion picture trash least film centered shepard might able add little spice otherwise rancid lowbudget teen comedy
