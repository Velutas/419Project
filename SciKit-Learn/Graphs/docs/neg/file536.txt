plunkett macleane period piece mired modern mtv pretentions 
 nothing mtv approach filmmaking used properly can save movie see stigmata ruins one making muddled incoherent mess potentially interesting premise 
 certain genres just dont go together 
 film opens sequence still dont understand 
 involves sort prison outbreak robbery gem keeps eaten 
 case caper whatever may brings together plunkett macleane robert carlyle johnny lee miller respectively two happygolucky brits way make living 
 make pact steal money rich give earn enough money buy ticket america 
 first heist involves young debutante named lady rebecca liv tyler woman macleane especially friendly party just earlier 
 decorum stripping valuables earns two crooks name gentleman highwaymen 
lady rebecca also happens niece lord chief justice glaringly arrogant man nearing end political career 
 demands robbers caught punished immediately leaving job hands devious chance ken stott things mind catching criminals 
meanwhile macleane falls love rebecca infuriating businesslike plunkett doesnt want plans foiled partners mindless romantic travails 
director jake scott son ridley scott alien blade runner fathers knack setting atmospheric shots none skill actually moving camera 
 action scenes filmed rapid jerky way impossible comprehend whats going 
 camerawork even nauseating purposefully dizzying blair witch project due lack fluidity 
instead utilizing panning shots impress upon us scope events scott uses attentiondeficitdisorder edits 
 barely ever holds shot ten seconds faster scenes seems like couple frames cut 
 weird almost defiant lack dialogue conversations lasting say seconds undermines character definition two protagonists come ciphers rather characters 
 love affair macleane rebecca different emotionless unrealistic 
 script calls macleane decide going america going meet lover reason us believe worth abandon goal rebecca barely even speak throughout film 
plunkett macleane wants desperately triumph style substance since style quite frankly blows film hope succeeding level 
 wanted appreciate movie basis admittedly kinetic pace couldnt kinetic gave headache
