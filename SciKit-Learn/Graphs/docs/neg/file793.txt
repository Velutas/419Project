theres good timely story trapped deep within excess murder first new movie abuses prison system 
 country wrapped feverish debate crime issue rights accused incarcerated jeopardy expose offer something rare recent american moviesa point view 
 director marc rocco makes clear beginning pretentious often nauseating camera movements slick mtv style lighting editing far important 
theres moment picture surrenders technique pure storytelling 
 everything suffers 
christian slater kevin bacon star defense attorney alcatraz inmate respectively 
 spending unprecedented amount time isolated cell attempting escape bacon murders another prisoner faces trial 
 young lawyer slater fresh law school determined put alcatraz trial abuses warden gary oldman 
 result usual courtroom theatrics imagine stanley kramer production shot hyperactive film school students 
theres little praise outside kevin bacons earnest overacting appropriate story 
theres lot overacting everyoneyou know youre trouble right away r lee ermey drill sergeant full metal jacket cast judge center reason moderation 
slater never convincing certainly isnt oldman bad streak hammy performances 
 worst feeling get watching murder first man behind camera care less telling good story 
 long exchanges dialogue camera even moving near characters let alone 
 frustrating must actors work conditions 
 theres anything alway distinguished american films rest world ability tell good story 
 forgotten
