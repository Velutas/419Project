yet another brainless teen flick one surprise drugs sex 
stars katie holmes sarah polly couldnt look bored 
 characters cardboard cutouts every cliched teenager 
one thing need know really hated movie 
everything annoyed hell 
 acting script plot ending 
 director fluke hit swingers well directed bunch noname actors watchabe film 
 big stars go pretty much drown project originality 
 felt like watching dawsons creek episode 
although film still stayed red despite cast 
 surprise ending sooo predictable 
since male characters sudden outing closet considered surprise hollywood anymore 
go dawsons creek varsity blues shes go home watch something else
