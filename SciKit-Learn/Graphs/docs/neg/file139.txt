 opinion film can easily swayed presence actors love 
 love ralph fiennes 
 love uma thurman 
 love sean connery 
hell im even big fan jim broadbent fiona shaw 
 saw fantastic preview avengers nearly eight months ago ive eagerly awaiting film ever since 
 months summer however noticed release date changed times ended midaugust dumping ground 
 final week official release learned screened critics 
 actors plugging film late night programs 
 directed man brought us remake diabolique 
 expectations fell pieces learned things 
 film saw today didnt even meet expectations 
 lousy incoherent mess 
 slam harder werent nifty sets mere presence fine lovable actors 
 sets ultimately empty performances completely uninspired 
thats main problem avengers hiphop flash tidal waves none feels least bit energetic inspired 
 like chore bland exercise superhero film making 
 also feels like cut pieces clocking minutes forgetting close subplots 
 just plain depressing 
 avengers film version popular s television show 
frequent readers mine will surprised learn ive never watched episode 
 wasnt alive 
 dont even watch television now 
im sorry dont perspective judging reviews ive already read knowing tv show just makes matters worse 
 didnt know love john steed emma peel therefore upset see actors love managed thrash roles 
 also doubt familiarity series allow understand clearly chain events take place film 
based film told gather steed fiennes kind british super guy somewhat like james bond dr peel thurman just really smart doctor also happens know lot weather beating people limited tight leather suits 
 work together mothers orders mother played jolly jim broadbent coconspirator father played equallytalented fiona shaw 
 seems man controlling weather 
 name de wynter connery 
 crazy scottish guy 
 heroes better stop else 
 
 
 weather will keep getting colder go hell warm one films funny lines 
along way subplot subplot hinged sloppily together scenes go nowhere feel perfunctory ultimately make sense 
 example heroes eventually attacked swarm giant mechanical insects machineguns attached torsos 
now killer bugs dont really go weathercontrolling theme film 
 purpose bugs annihilate heroes never established 
theyre never even directly connected de wynter theyre controlled crazy henchman played eddie izzard 
 special effects arent bad theyre loud obnoxious intrusive 
like many scenes film seems present keep attention waning 
 guarantee will wane 
 stopped thinking story realized didnt good think 
 avengers clearly chopped reassembled many times even people involved couldnt tell us happens 
 several scenes preview didnt make final cut 
 addition many sequences irritating grainy film quality makes feel lowbudget last scene particularly bad 
 scenes dont feature action electric thanks wonderful cast 
 arent 
 action scenes electric action film 
 arent either 
 wasted cast 
oh makes weep disappointment 
 talking ralph fiennes one best actors working today one best actors ever 
 love guy 
ive loved films one 
 seems like wants understand film hes lost 
 thurman spectacular beauty talent cant manage look home 
 dont blame completely strange subplot involving evil twin never explained way cant easy deal terrible screenwriting 
connery however seems totally lacking kind focus interest matter 
 blame 
 screenwriter don macpherson 
perhaps although can see shell story good superhero movie handled right 
 actors 
 gods sake people clearly lost interest saw inevitable path destruction film travelling 
 blame director jeremiah chechik shouldnt given task begin 
 best film benny joon quirky way one supposed mostly seems like lot failed attempts wit humor 
add lack experience bigbudget action worst choice director side james ivory 
 avengers saving grace set design 
 sets stuart craig big colorful often pleasing look 
 like final setpiece de wynters island even none makes bit sense 
 admired overhead view stairs showing dr peel running around circles never getting anywhere 
 also enjoyed michael kamens music score particularly opening credits 
 stuff routine good sets music nice theres lot needs 
inspiration instance really nice 
maybe little bit cohesion story 
 sense purpose 
 though liked see actors relish roles 
damn movie giving chance
