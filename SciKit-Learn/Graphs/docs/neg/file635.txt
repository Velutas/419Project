 didnt come city angels expecting greatness 
ive never seen wim wenders wings desire classic movie upon city loosely based 
 seen enough stories based upon similar plot device little mermaid disney version original folktale among high expectations possible power story impossible love can hold 
unfortunately city angels ended fulfilling 
 plot couldnt tell previews revolves around angel seth played almost creepy intensity nicolas cage midst angelic duties falls love heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan endearing performance since harry met sally 
 course angel prevents much love except appearing random times talk watch buy groceries disappear blink eye 
 love must remain unrequited unless seth decides make ultimate sacrifice become human 
using framework jumpingoff point movie attempts veer heavy philosophical ruminations nature desire joys human definition perfection 
 first half movie succeeds points 
cage excellently plays eminently difficult role angel doesnt know feelings cant really express preventing character seth getting boring despite limited repertoire intent looks hangdog expressions 
unfortunately cage takes intensity far sometimes seth comes across creepy sensitive 
 maggie ryan manages convincing heart surgeon trouble coming terms lost patient operating table despite done everything right 
 beauty unlike unbearable cuteness french kiss mature intelligent winning 
likewise interesting ideas float around beginning film 
 camera pans traffic jams libraries get hear thoughts random people flash across screen audience experiences little must like angel 
 beautiful camera work shooting onto hectic world los angeles improbable perches angels also gives us sense unique wonder angels feel 
 film begins lose way though focus tightens seth maggie 
 grand angelic perspective gets lost except idly tossed lines incredible beauty world angels eyes 
 movie devolves examination seth cant feel world importantly cant feel maggie cant smell hair feel touch taste pears eats 
 change focus attempts capture audience seths intense longing conflict disappears 
 wants maggie badly doesnt just make leap become human 
 whats great angel 
sure get sit marlboro signs whats compared getting meg ryan 
 yearning established romantic denouement must occur downhill 
 philosophy becomes heavyhanded dialogue pedestrian tries deep plot twists simply attempt yank tears audiences hankie 
 last thirty minutes movie wrecks film 
 feel like writer pulling melodramatic stops robbed genuinely powerful movie experience romantic philosophical level 
 came feeling robbed seeing much possibility film becoming nothing 
 go longer dont want ruin end revealing cheap plot devices film relies 
city angels paradox 
 wellacted particularly look dennis franz cutting typecasting happygolucky fallen angel wellfilmed based wonderful idea 
 possibilities though make film unredeemable closing credits come
