 considering david finchers latest film game four words come mind 
 dont believe hype 
 michael douglas vehicle director seven isnt nearly clever innovatively suspenseful us believe 
 film draws us intriguing concept aided doubt riveting trailer jaded millionaire douglas presented opportunity enter living fantasy 
 isnt simply virtual reality 
 real life deadly twist 
 th birthday nicholas van orton douglas invited dinner underachieving younger brother conrad sean penn 
conrad special birthday present brother 
 hands nicholas gift certificate tells contact company called consumer recreation services 
 make life fun conrad tells 
nicholas humors brother telling hell call clear time foolish fantasy roleplaying calls 
 reasons never really made clear nicholas decides go crs see theyre 
 ends spending whole day going screening process made sense considering tight schedule keeps claiming 
nevertheless seems nicholas rejected crs client weird things start happening 
 course weve covered minutes screen time else expect 
douglas built modern career around playing powerful violent unlikable men manipulated unseen hands 
one films basic instinct came creative minds writer joe eszterhas director paul verhoeven 
 premise game unlike concept another verhoeven film total recall 
 case premise implanting someone elses memories way enhance ones life dream vacation 
yet films real goal create vicarious bond audience 
 live adventure along protagonist reacting twist turn 
 theory key suspense tell real isnt 
 can hang end ride truth finally revealed 
now forgot let say 
 dont believe hype 
 game thrilling roller coaster ride 
 suspensethriller doesnt much spin circles 
 third reel fighting back sleep checking watch endured predictable plot 
 wonder douglas wont able resist charms mysterious potentially lifethreatening blonde ever heard glenn close 
 well sharon stone 
thought 
 anything film surprises guess havent seen many films 
 suspense 
trust looked hard find 
 settle contrived gimmicks ridiculously implausible situations 
fincher aims hitchcock lands somewhere just north joe eszterhas 
 might say game intended viewed literally 
 submit exactly way tried view film 
 film simply teeth bite real psychological issues 
 moment early film van orton realizing game begun smiles walks airport trying figure whos whole thing 
 charged paranoia 
 looking world new eyes 
 last thoughtprovoking moment film 
 director wants stay step ahead us 
 significant archetype set beginning film simply turned plot device 
 outset told game tailored individual 
ultimately game supposed work like crucible trying obscenely wealthy emotionally detached aristocrat fire proving soul 
yet douglas endures personal gauntlet given pieces puzzle illuminate us man really 
 wanted like film 
 look just anothergreat idea poorly realized 
 can think least two superior films watching film didnt mean seeing really happening 
bryan singers usual suspects one film truly unique ability get lost details pulling back show full masterpiece canvas 
also underrated jacobs ladder tim robbins film really watched twice recognize significance symbolism 
 two examples films dont simply manipulate manipulations sake 
 films use labyrinth structure lead us meaningful place 
one major issue comes game whether whole illusion just highly sophisticated con game 
well can tell right now youve spent dollars may asking thing
