take look following equation 
 christmas carolghostbustersscrooged 
yes scrooged odd mixture sentiment comedy horror get mixed two elements toghether 
scrooged alternatively sick gross funny sickly soppy 
bill murray plays frank cross t v executive horrible personality 
hes evil secretary actors crew everyone except t vs stations boss course played late robert mitchum however visited dead exec warns cross will visited three ghosts past present future called ghost yet come reason sure enough arrive show cross much s o b changes way 
however throughout simple plot weve got suffer outlandish special effects poor comedy mean performance bill murray 
frank cross isnt funny mean hes just mean 
 also isnt good emotional scenes totally destroys last ten minutes film utterly desperate speech saying great christmas changed 
however supporting cast ok good performances mitchum allen plays girlfriend john glover plays crosss partner ghost christmas past isnt bad either 
sadly though audience suffer minutes home alone style violence ghost christmas present played carol kane 
whoever thought smacking kane smacking murray head toaster funny fired straight away 
 audience also suffer bobcat goldthwait guy annoying voice police academy remeber correctly 
 thankfully dosent say much 
 script horrendous 
michael odonaghue churns terrible bad taste jokes guess whole point really changes direction completely emotional scenes 
 must drug wrote final ten minutes awful 
 special effects look nice nothing film 
theres impressive make effects also 
 music also good scored danny elfman 
 great effects make dont make great film 
scrooged appaling attempt inject christmas spirit audience seeing first hour minutes film depressing anyway last ten minutes make godawful speech 
 didnt cross just look exec window ask young boy buy goose 
overall youd much better christmas avoid film like something avoided perhaps plague
