bruce willis needs stay away straightforward action pictures 
mercury rising adds growing list including stinkers jackal last man standing striking distance last boy scout stale actioners headlined 
 though mercury rising tries spice things throwing autistic kid mix every bit stale 
art jeffries bruce willis typical tormented fbi agent 
 know type haunted job yet good even physically assaulting another agent merely gets slap wrist 
enter simon miko hughes autistic boy like rain man autistic people savant 
 can merely gaze superencrypted message little computer beeps go head can understand says 
naturally talent brought attention federal government 
lt col nicholas kudrow alec baldwin nsa official bubbling evil spent countless time money implementing newest unbreakable code mercury 
however two underlings robert stanton bodhi pine elfman publish mercuryencrypted message puzzle magazine final test effectiveness simon cracks code 
naturally infuriates kudrow sends terminatorlike hitman l l 
ginter eliminate security hazard 
 thats art jeffries comes 
 reason thats never explained film fbi called help series intricate machinations art becomes sole protector young autistic boy 
 unrealistic sequences enlists aid stranger stacey kim dickens help given little overall 
 central concept behind mercury rising ludicrous 
 bother trying kill kid 
mean know 
 like kid anyone else matter knew cracking government supercypher 
 even eliminated help

theres always chance someone else crack 
 guess without kid jeopardy theres much movie 
 faults film actually starts relatively well pass painfully familiar teaser 
 film flirts developing real characters semblance plot 
mr terminator hitman appears everything begins going downhill quickly 
miko hughes decent job age creating touching performance 
however dont go film looking new insights autism many people will 
instead merely becomes latest unique partner routine buddycop movie think cop half twist 
willis baldwin just overplaying type 
rather creating nuanced character baldwin simply oozes sliminess 
 willis part simply recycles stock role loner copfbi agent honed die hard series 
 almost afterthought halfway film carelessly gives character trait addiction drops next scene 
 biggest problem mercury rising screenplay 
 film wasnt well thought 
 film goes extraordinary lengths pad many convenient coincidences possible 
 carbon paper scene alone unworthy gullible audience member 
 first bad scenes just trickle gruesomely bad finale theyre veritable flood 
 films decent moments come form bad jokes mainly geeks developed supercode 
 theyre nearly enough make film worthwhile 
mercury rising thriller youre likely groan cheer
