capsule one ten worst movies ever made 
christopher lambert vs evil ninjas modernday japan 
 nobody wins 
 hunted bad movie completely inept totally braindamaged almost feel affection 
 see showing movie friends getting good jolly guffaw werent also insanely xenophobic insulting 
christopher lambert plays computerparts salesman whos business japan 
 meets slinky young woman joan chen torrid night lovemaking manages witness death hands evil ninja clan leader john lone 
apparently unfinished business concluded getting slaughtered 
since lambert witness hes course next one die 
lets stop think second 
 lambert real life chased fanatical devotees ninja secret society hed lifespan measure atomic clock 
 movie ninja manage kill just everyone except 
 imagine japanese gods smiled lambert provided goof field radiates ten feet body 
 know goof field invisible zone anyone intent harm becomes klutz matter real dexterity 
 course beginning movies problems 
lambert eventually finds pseudosafety longhaired modernday samurai yoshio harada partner yoko shimada may remember lady toda buntaro shogun 
 two best things movie every scene authority presence actually look like belong even dressed full samurai armor wielding bows 
 script doesnt know hell 
lone bad guy zerodimensional 
 badguy cliche wallow around one bad guy always exotic women dripping 
 hunted elevated level insulting stereotype 
whats funny peripheral characters hunted sterotypes theres nice little scene tokyo cabdriver girl pachinko parlor many main characters unsalveageably hateful 
also phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo assembled superior soundtrack get cd manages survive despite drek designed accompany 
 extended battle scene middle movie almost reason enough watch whole thing gory excellently staged fight bullet train shows real imagination moment smothers trying clumsily recouple whole thing movies relentlessly stupid plot 
 time get final showdown lambert getting wield sword judging hamhanded editing one scene forged seven hours longer care 
 even given definitive information whether one key characters lives dies 
someone said key good art good movies good books whatever start somewhere interesting end somewhere interesting show respect audience along way 
 movie bungles two three badly
