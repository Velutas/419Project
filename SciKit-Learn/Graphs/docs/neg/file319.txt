 jailbreak killer puts big sunglasses wears halfbuttoned jacket uses fatal charm go valerie 
comments alan smithee directed fatal charm appropriately titled fatal bore fatal crap 
 find film youre see directed alan smithee seriously seriously seriously consider watching something anything else 
 alan smithee pseudonym number directors used produce something really bad 
frankly id embarrassed directed turkey think understand director might picked alan smithee moniker film 
 begin painfully poor thriller 
lets start acting 
 pretty bad 
amanda peterson plays valerie shows least talent rest cast dont even though performance isnt exactly stellar material 
shes also miscast seems way old still year high school complete 
 scenes valeries mother played mary frann joke 
 two look though theyre couple coworkers going lunch together rather daughter mother just doesnt understand 
christopher atkins handsome enough actor plays killer adam looks like clown second half fatal charm 
trying appear malicious dangerous wears large sunglasses halfbuttoned jacket 
 disney decided zany comedy caper unabomber atkins probably perfect candidate lead doesnt cut 
early movie number scenes occurs courtroom 
outside laughably poor performances given actors portraying lawyers people sitting benches provide silliest effort drama film 
 constantly shift turn arc heads mock interest got one worst perfomances large group people given one time ever 
fatal charms storyline inspires yawns thrills 
 script belabors red herring early second suspect may committed murders adam atkins charged 
 suspect however turns strangled drowned halfway film obvious plot fault 
even idiots didnt consider movies title valerie blond newsreporter commented innocent charming defendant seemed becomes quite obvious adam dangerous suspect washes 
 audience must wait havent already stopped watching necessary details fall place killer goes heroine drawnout finale 
 video box dud describes fatal charm erotic thriller 
 thriller isnt neither particularly erotic 
 cant imagine someone mood something erotic hed happy watching fluff 
 erotic moments occur film take place van little lighting filmed focus see theyre supposed valeries fantasies creative 
 personal note disturbed ludicrous english literature class shown film valerie suffer 
 wonder hated high school much 
 instructor english hard time accepting fact course emphasizing great literature teacher stoop reading students bad poetry course valeries boyfriends loud embarassing author front class questions poems inspiration 
 guess public school system still setting dubious standards students 
fatal charm wont charm anyone unless theres someone thats charmed boring lifeless insipid suspenseless thrillers 
 happen upon turkey just keep moving
