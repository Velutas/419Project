 snake eyes aggravating kind movie kind shows much potential becomes unbelievably disappointing 
 just brian depalma film since hes great director one whos films always greeted least fanfare 
 even film starring nicolas cage since gives brauvara performance film hardly worth talents 
 worse 
 aggravating sole reason story much totally intelligent opens absolutely subtlety will handled complexly intensely one point movie makes wrong turn leads hall fame halfassedness 
 deservedly hall fame eighthassedness 
 certain circles snake eyes advertised kind modern day version kurosawas classic rashomon crime told four different mean different perspectives looks though may actually just like opening might add superb 
 one long steadicam shot meet protagonist crooked atlantic city detective rick santoro cage follow boxing match talks cell phone wife interupts payperview event tv chases gambler enters arena pumped fight sits talks bud kevin dunne gary sinise whos character confused actor kevin dunn whos also watches happens 
theres big name crowd thats secretary defense charles kirkland joel fabiani whos sitting behind rick gets shot second heavyweight champion lincoln tyler stan shaw knocked 
 happens opening shot creates many red herrings possibilities happened opens scene close examination total deconstruction 
 really happened film asks sets film extremely well rick begins question people get different perspectives scene 
discovers theres good possibility conspiracy 
 follow rick trying learn information also meet woman talking kirkland shot carla gugino flees scene panic tries hide cops arena adjacent casinohotel since cops blocked doors can get witness takes happened 
 going pretty fine dandy extremely interesting watch 
 takes one wrong step 
 follow wrong character learn answer mystery early way rick can find 
 thats worst part one person didnt think obviously supposed red herring one didnt think stupid cliched person behind 
 gets worse film turns chase film half way film since already know happened cant rely ricks investigation interesting 
 film ran guts really complex original third way decided just fall back easy way just happens mean become less less credible 
events become proposterous end film decided rely worst offender mysteries like deux ex machina 
thats outside intereference brings film sudden conclusion makes everything okay 
 time hurricane outofcontrol police car big round ball adorned arena 
 went wrong 
depalma screenwriter david koepp extremely credible people respective fields known bringing life complexity mysteries 
depalma idolizes hitchcock death done many film like masterpiece blow movie soundman uses movie elements uncover conspiracy piece piece 
 granted depalma least makes intriguing watch overthetop shot setups notably beginning sequence camera pans top bunch rooms hotel forgetting anything boundaries 
 least direction makes partly 
 theres koepp showed great ability making characters flaws come life like depalmas earlier carlitos way film dove right life past character examined extremely well 
 can write flawed character rick santoro seems just halfassed effort 
hes flawed can see redemption story wasnt formulaic 
 scene towards end make fatal decision cheapened fact answer emotional buildup 
 may well said opposite says least gone character like 
 disappointing kind film promises intelligence complexity promises disection flawed character perhaps even redemption pulls rug us just convinced able go way 
 watching first half hour couldnt wait see mystery unearthed many different perspectives hed given perhaps hed make choice whos believe 
now theres film 
unfortunately film two major deux ex machinas one disasterous ending half hour film goes autopilot becomes stale recycled piece crap weve seen much never someone like depalma
