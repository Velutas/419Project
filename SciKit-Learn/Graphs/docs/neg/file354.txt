 watch proceedings painfully graphic dreaded 
question springs mind 
 way movie made id guessed spike lee trying tell us something searched deeper became clear little find 
lee touches much media s punk scene details actual killings well characters personal dilemmas doesnt bring topics together form coherent theme make discernible statement 
 lost movie turns hollow can saving grace film enjoyable 
 bad summer sam doesnt get help 
frankly bore redundant repetitive two hour twenty minute film doesnt entertain beyond first half hour 
 suspense film refuses fully murders little involving drama film muddled focus vague 
leguizamos turn vinnie annoying whiny 
 script makes clear supposed believe character flawed still good guy 
youd never guess performance 
adrian brody especially mira sorvino fare better 
sorvino gives riveting touching performance banal movie im tempted think liked nearly everything else around inane character affecting emotions truetoheart 
brody paints effective portrait young guy desperate attention gets little bargained 
summer sam superficial elements good film looks great notable performances suppose pretty well directed purely technical way 
 also empty pretentious boring 
like last years thin red line movie director doesnt know wants say goes ahead says anyway
