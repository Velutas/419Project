 movie tries present sequel jan de bonts debut director surprise hit speed 
 thing two movies common sandra bullock female lead 
annie sandra bullock wrong place wrong time 
shes going cruise new boyfriend alex jason patric course ship kidnapped john geiger willem dafoe bone pick shipping line 
 sacked got sick 
now wants diamonds stored ships safe compensation 
 actually whole storyline 
speed without dialogues 
 movie images remarkable sound 
 dont really know called action movie 
except scenes vaguely reminiscent speed goes along lines desaster movies ies 
first introduced number people going important later movie 
 desaster strikes 
sandra bullock said glad take action time around 
 looked action couldnt find 
 time part decoration 
 time part happens can shot defusing bomb freeing passengers trapped behind fire door 
now know can handle chain saw 
 also know fire doors cruise ships can cut apart seconds 
 bomb defusal course goes wrong furniture damaged heroes still needed 
jason patric alias alex spends time flirting annie helping passengers frolicking water 
 initial seasickness suddenly gone ship crew passengers saved evil geiger 
 pretty good job cant blame keanu reeves declining part 
 theres willem dafoe villain desperately tries look frightening frankensteins monster 
 doesnt succeed though 
 untidy appearance isnt enough convince viewer psychopath potential 
 tries make us believe dangerous man practise front mirror 
 cant really recommend speed will probably like movie like funny situations arent meant funny 
especially showdown ship first runs oil tanker dissembles whole village treat 
 get see superfluous scene movie 
 keeping last years desaster movie tradition dog miraculously saved certain death 
 really funny meant funny scene takes place oil tanker right collision 
 crew members watch two ships colliding old movie 
 looked window wouldnt missed huge ship racing toward 
 still want see movie pick theater large screen good sound system enjoy visual effects phantastic surround sound effects 
 adequately equipped theater explosion going around can feel seats vibrate 
 ilm special effects cant save movie 
 money done better
