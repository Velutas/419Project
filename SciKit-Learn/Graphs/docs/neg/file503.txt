 blues brothers wonderful film hilarious comedy packed good music 
 cried sequel john belushis untimely death seemed eliminate idea 
however eighteen years passed long dormant sequel finally emerged 
unfortunately sequel worthy original 
 film starts exactly eighteen years first one ended 
elwood blues dan aykroyd just getting jail brother jake recently died 
 first film first visits mother mary stigmata kathleen freeman sets getting band back together 
john belushis absence leaves terrible hole film although three new characters created fill void still noticeable 
first theres cabel joe morton illegitimate son elwoods stepfather played cab calloway first movie 
cabel reluctant join destiny spends movie illinois sheriff chasing blues brothers band 
next theres mighty mack john goodman bartender becomes new lead singer band 
finally theres buster j 
evan bonifant ten year old orphan tags along elwood eventually joins band 
 plotting film hardly original 
seems almost clone original 
elwood go reluctantly retrieve member band travel pursued police perform several odd stops finally reach big concert finale 
 first film neonazis random element time around russian mafia militia group fill role 
 fact duplication plot ridiculously complete certain scenes practically identical original 
remember classic performance country bobs like types music country western first movie 
well movie performance country fair band expected play bluegrass music 
theres massive police car pileup although time gag falls completely flat 
theres even exact replica conversion scene church reverend cleophus james brown 
 plenty recurring characters 
 addition mother stigmata reverend cleophus aretha franklin reprises role mrs murphy 
frank oz prison guard first film makes appearance prison warden 
 stars new blues brothers dont live legacy 
aykroyd loquacious yet much flatter elwood 
john goodman barely character mighty mack 
joe morton deepest character terribly interesting one cab 
 whats deal orphan 
 plays like desperate gimmick doesnt mesh rest film 
 least bonifant isnt precocious role 
 true star saving grace film music 
 film packed even ending credits 
although brilliant mergers comedy song originals rawhidestand man medley music much enjoyable 
 top film packed gills cameo musician appearances 
b b king blues traveler eric clapton travis tritt wilson pickett erykah badu bo diddley steve winwood just sampling multitude stars make appearance 
unfortunately music pauses allow familiar plot 
 simply copying original blues brothers wasnt bad enough writers aykroyd john landis dumb removing memorable characters replacing flashy unbelievable magical gimmicks 
 shame 
buy soundtrack avoid film 
better yet rewatch original youll 
 much better time
