im sure writing review witches eastwick im sure just hell pardon expression going 
however can express important observation made e 
 didnt like 
 summarize film think id conclude updating one old new england folk tales someone selling souls old scratch try get deal 
thats kernel anyway 
tossed little bits pieces occasionally seem saying something men women feminism role devil modern reformers friendship 
unfortunately little effort ever made follow elucidate concepts theyre simply thrown left rot film goes apace 
actually think audience even confused 
 came expecting kind supernatural comedy level ghostbusters bit confused getting folk tale philosophical overtones 
 laughed tried laugh moments either barely funny much horrible funny bend film away rather frightening direction 
three women cher susan sarandon michelle pfieffer live eastwick small midwestern town 
one night drinking late evening begin wishing ideal man drop lives 
 seeming answer idle daydreams wealthy eccentric moves mansion hill seduces one attempting everything want 
 soon shows evidence mysticalperhaps demonicpower devotion womens merest fantasies wishes dangerous overtones 
even worse ignored moods become ugly mistreats women spurning 
anyway problems three female characters fairly uninteresting several cardboard stereotypes especially sarandons character 
 never get inside never feel sympathetic dialogue personalities seem pretty bland 
 nicholson well even devil needs direction go darryl van horne interesting character movie due grace screenwriter importantly nicholsons acting still cant yanked one direction another without making little vague 
 theres special effects 
 themselvesthey werent goodbut overuse 
 almost positive saw credits witches eastwick either produced alexander salkind turned slop named superman ii iii supergirl big name actors dopy stunts stephen spielberg th vomit scene nicholsonblowndownthestreet stunt 
nope another bunch guys directed george miller shown great skill stuntsspecial effects road warrior nightmare feet episode twilight zone movie apparently doesnt know turn wind machine let people act 
fgawds sake guys jack nicholson 
let loose 
let grin demonically 
skip splitting earth fake lightning 
watching scene nicholson tossed car voodoo doll think waste 
 youre going use slapstick like use pee wee herman 
nicholson can role can find bearings can extremely good scene church instance time seems bit stiff hes sure next 
 wonder 
 script goes map giving feeling itd just love allegory sure maybe give time itll think something 
 witches eastwick 
 horror movie 
 folk tale 
 comedy 
 statement women 
 examination religious right comparitive morality 
 tend think image seems dominate movie watching 
someone regurgitate halfdigested bits food cherry pits rooms people screen ultimately audience 
 words mess 
 
 like nicholson enough watch maybe charm able make logjams others
