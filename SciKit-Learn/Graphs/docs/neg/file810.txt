die hard altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior original every respect 
place blame squarely shoulders steven de souza doug richardson wrote films pathetic screenplay 
every line dialogue reeks either smarmy sap forced humor 
 plot altogether implausible convoluted story line involves band terrorists take dulles airport shut control tower leaving dozen planes stranded air waiting land 
 film zero credibility characters come cliched cardboard cutouts 
 much script 
 action 
well lets put way director renny harlin learn things john mctiernan directed original well hunt red october predatorall standouts hairraising suspense 
 contrast harlin doesnt clue comes choreographing action consequently die hard never picks steam 
die harder impossible take seriously even minute 
 fact movie often seems deliberately campy almost reaches threshold bad good 
 laugh laugh film 
die hard never cleared takeoff
