 looking forward film since heard early last year matthew perry just signed 
im big fan perrys subtle sense humor addition think chris farleys onedge extreme acting riot 
 naturally trailer almost heroes hit theaters almost jumped 
 soda hand lights dimming ready blown away farleys final starring role supposed matthew perrys big breakthrough 
 ready just amazed among farleys best spite david spades absence 
 ready laughing head minute credits ran 
sadly none came pass 
 humor spotty best good moments laughable oneliners far 
perry farley chemistry role perry cast seems obviously written spade type humor perry associated 
 movie tries smart subject best left alone farley flick 
 movie major dissapointment scenes worth first look let alone second 
perry delivers one humorous line whole movie surprisingly reason movie made top ten grossing list opening week advertised farley 
 farleys classic humor widespread 
almost heroes almost works misses wagontrain quite longshot 
guys lets leave exploring lewis clark huh 
stick tommy boy well friends
