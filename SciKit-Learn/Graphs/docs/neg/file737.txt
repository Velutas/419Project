 battlefield earth best comedy year 
 
 prospect just horrifying consider 
bad movie syndrome struck witnessing much battlefield earth proclaimed train wreck critical popular circles felt masochistic urge see disaster firsthand 
 bad advertised 
oh yes much 
 plot incomprehensible 
 acting atrocious 
 special effects mediocre 
 action dull 
 implausibilities legion 
 dialogue cringeinducing 
 whole package funny wants serious irritating wants funny 
 dont even want continue reviewing movie id like purge atrocity mind soon possible probably want read thrashing sarcastic glory 
 premise basically ripoff planet apes minus apes philosophical discussion plus race evil aliens planet psychlo 
 year psychlos conquered earth human population enslaved 
 handful humans escaped radiationrich areas escape aliens live lives fear 
one man johnny goodboy know know tyler barry pepper ventures outworld captured psychlos 
 confronts psychlo head security big ugly klingonlooking creature called terl john travolta 
pressed slavery johnny vows lead revolution take planet back 
meanwhile terl faced problems recently learned hes stuck living earth hates rest career pissed boss sleeping big mans daughter 
 decides give johnny knowledge psychlo language technology plot gets ridiculous 
 
 
 mananimal can lead mining expedition places psychlos cant go 
terl plans keep mined gold 
 course plan doesnt work 
 many things wrong movie begin 
 travolta whose hollywood clout brought cinematic version scientology guru l ron hubbards scifi novel 
early previews battlefield earth constant shots makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor several audience members remarking hell travolta thinking 
 movie nothing stem remarks 
 ridiculous cackling trailers full force terl cackles nearly every line every psychlo 
 course makes every scene hilariously overwrought script clumsily stumbles political commentary 
 psychlos probably supposed kind satire corporate america ceos generally dont laugh maniacally denying pay raises employees 
 going promoted now youre 
fwahahahahahahahaha 
 big surprise terl loses humans hes idiot 
 breaks every kind supervillain rule book 
 underestimates enemies assuming hell win just hes smarter 
 uses word leverage like sort scientologist mantra 
 content go james bond villain route explaining plans hero hooks machine gives knowledge psychlos language technology 
 machine even around first place beyond 
 appears shocked johnny points gun 
 wonder guy never got promotion 
 plot inconsistencies numerous mention 
 psychlos build earth base human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses survive 
 come psychlos wasting time mining gold doors fort knox wide open 
 world fighter jets survive sitting hangar years 
 previously braindead cavemen learn fly quickly 
theres whole lot scratch ones head battlefield earth 
bring scorecard track plot holes 
director roger christian shoots battlefield earth distracting way possible tilting nearly every shot sideways discernible reason 
 characters appear standing walls awfully difficult watch movie must tilt head just watch ordinary passages dialogue 
 action sequences atrociously edited every one turned endless slowmotion parade drains potential excitement 
 things really hard construct 
 respect supposed lightweight action directors grown leaps bounds witnessing battlefield earth badly action sequence can shot 
 movie absolute headache 
 just shot selection editing movie quite frankly makes sense 
 battlefield earths running time just didnt know happening 
 didnt anything finding events stupid illogical though certainly really idea hell going 
 pieced plot together later didnt look better 
heres much disaster battlefield earth already worst movie year going take something really really inept top 
 thing can take comfort film one will suckered joining church scientology 
 fact id think hubbards cult want distance bomb fast possible 
thatll teach give bad movie syndrome
