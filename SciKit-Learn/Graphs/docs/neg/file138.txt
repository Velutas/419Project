 thing worse watching bad movie realizing film lot potential couldve effective 
 case urban legend new horror film first time director jamie blanks 
 idea behind movie mad slasher film muders people according various urban legends 
examples include killer backseat car person getting calls inside house 
 killer wears one l l bean parkas hood drawn completely cant see face 
 guess halloween masks style psychos days 
anyhow premise certainly nifty one opening scene spooky atmospheric 
 good setup promises chills come 
unfortunately film never takes 
 movie takes place peaceful new england college campus 
like slasher flicks one also centers around young female main character whose friends slowly killed knife wielding maniac case axe wielding maniac 
ive always wondered killers dont save lot time trouble just go person ultimately aim kill 
 fine first scene movie degenerates monotonous series annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares 
 always accompanied loud bursts music 
 guess sudden sharp music chords passes terror days 
 actual killer will attack every third music blast 
 slasher appears attacks victim eviscerated tedious cycle appears anew 
false scares always used moderation 
someone needs tell director blanks things like just arent scary used 
 movie commits biggest sin horror film can commitits frightening 
remember horror movie cliches mercilessly mocked scream scream 
 movie still adheres 
tons illogical moments really inclination list 
 dont mean illogical summer popcorn movie sense 
 type illogical can fun 
 film insults intelligence times care remember 
 last minutes especially degenerates lunacy youll laughing youll screaming 
actually wont screaming 
 best acting can barely called adequate script couldve definitely used rewrite two 
 film still manages strong points 
 killings certainly inventive plentiful enough satistfy gore fans 
 intentionally funny moments 
 exceeded unintentional ones 
 film well made technical standpoint 
besides first part also another good scene prolonged cat mouse chase inside radio station 
 sequences like relied tautness suspense rather loud bursts music urban legend mightve worth money
