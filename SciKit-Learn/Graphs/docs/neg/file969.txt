 watching loser occurred amy heckerlings true genius filmmaker casting 
 fast times ridgemont high gave us sean penns jeff spicoli look whos talking turned bruce willis wisecracking baby provided john travolta first career revival clueless found star vehicle adorableness alicia silverstone 
 seems understand instinctively find performers audience will like spite flaws 
unfortunately may also starting understand understands 
giving appealing actors appealing script creates likeable movies 
giving appealing actors script appeal movie makes unexpectedly awful films like loser 
naturally heckerling makes protagonist allaround swell guy 
paul tannek jason biggs smalltown boy gets scholarship nyu instantly finds island compassion diligence coldhearted big city 
paul kind guy gives seat subway elderly woman roommates adam zak orth chris tom sadoski noah jimmi simpson kind guys blast music let waterbeds leak paul 
paul also kind guy adores girls afar case lovely dora diamond mena suvari 
dora problems including shortage funds pay tuition relationship professor edward alcott greg kinnear thats slightly onesided 
theyre two conscientious kids love animals homeless people clearly belong together even paul loser 
 must confess suckered heckerlings casting 
jason biggs engaging performer whose unconventional looks make even easier embrace suvari coquette undercurrent intelligence 
theyre pleasant enough watch heckerling gives us plenty scenes establishing nice nice respective antagonists arent 
 gradually becomes clear theres virtually nothing loser scenes sort 
 theory loser romantic comedy scarcely laugh found entire film notable exception cameo scenestealing comic actor video store clerk 
instead taking time make characters situations funny heckerling spends minutes making characters situations pathetic 
 shows none ear quirky dialogue sparked clueless films interest lively plotting surprisingly since cluelesss plot came via jane austens emma 
 simply turns film pity party 
since loser film composed almost entirely establishing character might think characters interesting least slightly complicated 
instead people either perfect unredeemable theres reason watch 
paul isnt just nice guy hes flawless consequently hes central character absolutely growing 
 roommates arent just inconsiderate theyre actively evilblackmailing professor alcott drugging women rohypnol generally giving humanity bad name 
 professor alcott isnt just manipulative turns dora house slave 
doras unthinking devotion alcott whiff basic human frailty found loser even isnt explored sufficient detail 
theres ambiguity second snippet alan cummings broadway performance emcee cabaret rest loser one thing turn supporting characters comic exaggerations another flatten leads easily digestible mush 
 help comic exaggerations somehow 
 dont know 
comic 
still spent much film holding ridiculous hope heckerling somehow salvage loser tedium justify desire like paul dora 
 hope dissolved moment heckerling underscored sequence paul throes unrequited love simon garfunkels scarborough faircanticle 
instead giving sequence knowing winka reference graduate hint paul becoming overlysensitive clichheckerling plays deadly straight 
even scenes scream light comic touch bit poke protagonists foibles finds impossible stray gospel paul saint 
cluelesss cher selfabsorption manipulative tendencies balance cuteness 
 loser amy heckerling shows leaden hand material demands friskiness one show wit involves naming pauls dorm hunts hall erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall 
 gift casting proved curse 
loser may crashing bore gee arent two kids swell
