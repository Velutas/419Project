romeo bleeding wants carry unusual flavor reservoir dogs bad lieutenant 
 director peter medak whose previous credits include good films let krays topnotch character actors gary oldman lena olin seemed likely successful combination 
 mentioned films however brought something screen romeo bleeding solid wellwritten screenplay 
call cynical jobs writer producer dont seem mix well 
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi good cop turned bad selling information mob cheating wife 
 cheating obvious enough obtain nickname although name doesnt provide insight analogy shakespearean character 
jack become addicted feeding hole hole ground stores payoff money 
 realizes colleagues shot feebly attempts get 
gary oldmans performance disappointingly weak seems nearly bored 
 process also gets tangledup mona demarkov russian mobsterette wants take territory top boss falcone played adequately roy scheider 
demarkov played lena olin tough tremendously sexy woman seemingly problems maneuvering within mob world 
 character combination linda hamilton arnold schwarznegger terminator cant remember seeing character quite like 
 shot handcuffed thrown back seat car still manages cause accident kick windshield legs grab suitcase full money plus important documentation climb rubble land shot leg still succeed running safety 
 woman 
lena olins performance glimmer dismal film 
anabella sciorra wasted role romeos wife 
 little insight character 
shes depressed makes obvious references mopes around house 
juliette lewis romeos girlfriend treated cliche attitudes although ms lewis portrayal certainly didnt improve 
 women anything sexy attractive 
poorly developed characters aside screenplay also suffers several logistical problems 
 discouraging watch film want shout main character something 
 example jack friends attend funeral hang background scopeout mob scene 
fine 
jack spots big boss goons gravesite 
fine 
 jack proceed 
 brushes friends telling isnt feeling well strolls boss 
 
 boss ready threatened falcone simply takes opportunity issue threats ordering goons take jacks toes gravesite 
 guess werent worried federal agents lingering around funeral 
 heres another demarkov setup death cutting arm circular saw 
 proceeded set place fire 
wouldnt flames burn fingerprints 
arent dental records important 
 bright resourceful supposed couldnt come better plot 
 took time get goodfitting functional prosthesis 
lack attention detail certainly adds film 
 film doesnt even add large details 
 little consistency storyline 
 much makes sense 
 direction lacks cohesion surprising director whose previous credits impeccable 
 moods shift styles shift one can seem decide serious film satire one 
 certainly isnt reservoir dogs certainly isnt diva 
theres plenty tear apart film 
 advice someone hasnt seen wait comes video 
 quotable lines provide campy evening taken seriously 
 boring film just good one 
 intelligent one
