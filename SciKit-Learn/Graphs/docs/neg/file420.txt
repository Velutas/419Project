 something bad 
 must sitting movie sheer punishment 
heres plot 
ricky jeff goldblum producer goodbuy network one hour home shopping channels 
 new boss robert loggia plans can rickys behind doesnt turn previous months flat sales numbers around add problems ricky also work kate kelly preston ivy league wunderkind boss brought 
kate ricky dont get along dont great ideas meet g eddie murphy spiritualist sees something positive everything 
 soothing voice simple logic makes people feel good quality will make g new gbn television star key networks success 
 first problem flaw plot 
sure g makes people feel good 
sure told people feel guilty buying impulse item matter wealthy might ill even believe g talks talk allows people feel good theyve bought 
 hey thats theyve bought 
 sales skyrocket first time g camera 
far trying sell product g instead blathers dont even need thing 
someone please tell supposed move merchandise first place 
 might say people feel good theyve bought come back due simple fact first round sales inexplicable im convinced filmmakers mind 
 whole movie therefore seriously undermined key point plot never credible 
another problem humor 
 know see eddie murphy movie think unreasonable expect film comedy 
whoa partner surprise 
holy man funny 
murphy one asset youd think movie remember brought last minute save best defense 
 maybe dont seriously reigned 
 script gives almost nothing work seems though director stephen herek kept toned actors film wouldnt left window dressing 
theres one moment film murphy allowed let loose lasts three shouted words seem totally place result 
pathetic 
 three jokes work entire picture theyre even great 
 side note cameo appearances dan marino pitching contraption allows cook car engine james brown introducing medicalert device shouts help 
just like hardest working man show business push button never cause personal laughometer rise level mild bemusement 
 well ask surely must convincing performances make lack humor 
think buckwheat 
jeff goldblum disappoints 
kelly preston flat like 
robert loggia kind role virtually typecast cant anything 
 script part problem actors dont even look like believe move theyre making 
 look lot like theyre bored 
just like audience 
 humor absent comedy acting like siberian steppes 
 film drags dropped anchor 
 wait 
 problems dont make film slow enough screenplays pacing makes movie even slower 
 takes entire first half hour establish movies premise time film wades tortuous seemingly mandatory romance ricky kate subplot involving conniving pr man eric mccormack wants discredit g take rickys job producer 
 pr guys plan foiled film climaxes treated little epilogue can go home right 
wrong 
 movie goes another half hour 
continental drift indy compared pace holy man 
 thing holy holy man will surely number people exclaiming holy movie awful 
 one truly pious
