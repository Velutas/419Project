studio attracted many weird bizarre people gates wonder film life death studio centers one boring cliched individual mention ensemble people wouldnt fascinating unless worked studio according film 
 supposed believe strange folk populated studio nightly character bland ripoff tony manero really make good protagonist film 
 belongs elite group films known big disappointments films attain much hype andor much potential creation come worse finally finished 
 heavily awaiting least ive become fascinated infamous club subject engrossing documentary thats running summer vh weirdly enough much intriguing engrossing edgy film 
perhaps importantly part blossoming subgenre s nostalgia film picking mighty steam boogie nights last days disco coming within year damn good movies captured feel certain time period late s party early s wakeup period brought us interesting real characters like scotty tragically gay boom mike operator boogie nights charlotte ironically clueless bitchy coprotagonist last days disco mention several others 
 deals much timeline studio began run ended thats dealt narrated opening finale interested characters populated 
 definite plus 
heres film fascinating hour plus film tragic people went party wakeup s things like diseases economy problems perhaps worst reagan hit forced everyone rude awakening 
 story studio tragedy lets look affected people 
 film doesnt let happen 
 gives us halfassed protagonist named shane oshea ryan phillippe know last summer whos chief character trait fact hes new jersey also happens chief character flaw guess 
hes dimwitted part scene soon finds hes become bit rave amongst studio regulars 
bit like saturday night fever cept travolta real interest put 
poor poor phillippe struggles make interesting halfassed character ticket glimpse decadence going inside club 
shane begins hang denizens club like anita salma hayek wannabe donna sommers young hubby greg randanzo breckin meyer clueless helps shane become bartender rise bit fame 
although begins get somewhere sleeps foxy billie auster sela ward exec sorts falls lust soap star named julie black neve campbell thus boring romance subplot thats necessarily important anything else film never really becomes interesting point film 
 films sole point interest one major strongpoint alltoo necesary personage steve rubell played mike myers heard 
rubell famous head studio acted never stopped partying ever easy metaphor life times creation film thanks surprisingly strong performance myers makes 
notice scenes sole shocking scene tries get felatio one male employees turn promotion myers brings humanity rubell scene couple others us whove seen tv never saw proves perhaps one aspect studio film actually nails 
first time feature director mark christopher proves hes better director writer though terribly much 
 story trite shallow characters direction shockingly flat especially film subject 
 great story tell instead opted easier route 
 studios recreation amazingly accurate though impressive direction never captivating enough 
 people say film job makes want visit locale takes place despite films tone still want go rome many nightclubs saw fellinis la dolce vita watched didnt particularly want stay
