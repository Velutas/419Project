 generals daughter heartless absurd film movie hopelessly dedicated inane plot forgets entirely characters 
director simon west treats issues like rape sexual fetish hamhanded obscenity creating film banks almost entirely exploitation offensive pseudodepth 
whats worse movie haphazardly glued together two characters neither interesting sympathetic ridiculous story requires unbelievable things interest reaching dark conclusion sudden rain storm 
john travolta finds middle mess playing warrant officer paul brenner brenner assigned find murderer rape captain elizabeth campbell leslie stefanson daughter general joe campbell james cromwell 
brenner teamed exspouse sarah sunderland madeline stowe check suspects base including elizabeths mentor colonel moore james woods 
soon becomes apparent elizabeth kinky sexual stuff question comes course 
eberts law economy characters can applied one interesting thing noted characters suspects point including two protagonists almost end directly intertwined story 
perhaps issued spoiler alert mentioning painfully obvious beginning everyone film hiding something 
 story level generals daughter ineptly constructed 
 film adapted christopher bertolini william goldman nelson demilles novel apparently based true story plods along conclusion filling blanks stale unrealistic dialogue shocking plot developments 
 read novel difficult determine problems fault adapters original author suppose guilty degree 
scene scene stumbles pointless insincerity minutes finding dead young woman brenner sunderland engage sarcastic dialogue includes endless strings forced lines 
 sunderland actually asks brenner killed 
 answered knew movie already 
 weve spent twenty minutes characters learn sordid history together angle though apparently present develop characters never explored 
 really matters since characters consistently ludicrous things reason drive plot 
 one scene sunderland attacked man mask 
 sees one rings brenner find man later day based ring 
instead questioning like real suspect take brenners houseboat beat pour hot coffee lap 
 scene really pushed edge gratuitous meanspirited illustrates films complete disregard characters audience 
 impossible feel anything people beyond scene mostly nothing comes surprise 
 realized constructs screen arent actually characters devices present serve story 
 bad enough without wests need hose movie tasteless images rape sexual misconduct 
compelling films sexual crimes dont spend lot time rape flashbacks certainly dont show much skin sweat typical pornographic picture 
 scenes least bit powerful contrary theyre intended simply provide audience necessary resentment villain whomever may turn 
 addition movie treats sexual fetishes sadomasochism particular perversion everything know pure 
 standpoint certainly allowed accompaniment welldeveloped themes back 
 film forgets lot people sexual fetishes putting pair handcuffs make person insane 
perhaps positive elements generals daughter couple performances 
james woods terrific scenes plays role sharp witty subtlety 
 also liked james cromwell mostly comes across slightly sympathetic despite obvious intent west make villainous 
nonetheless performances undermined entirely dreary obligatory atmosphere senseless neglect characterization 
 generals daughter worst kind hollywood film pretends soul strict moral code fact nothing group cardboard cutouts forcefeeding audience toxic landfill plot contrivances onesided moral judgments
