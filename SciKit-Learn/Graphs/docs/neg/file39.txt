capsule tonight leni rienfenstal 
starship troopers expensive hateful unenjoyable piece violent pornography bad pornography 
 good cinema good storytelling even stupid fun cynically calculatedly boneheaded even least demanding members audience alternately bored revulsed 
 one worst movies ive seen long time 
 calling movie pornography 
pornography abstract anything calculated appeal baser instincts 
 remember reading review full metal jacket described climact moment end movie private joker shoot downed vc sniper nearpornographic eternity 
 didnt agree assessment see implied reviewer felt audience incited stand pump fists shout er man er 
 sentiment echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers 
 literally like giant recruitment film gone berserk 
 tries frantically enlist emotions winds dull sickening 
 film takes place future earth come attack alien species doesnt appear intelligence 
 counterattack humankind single stupidest thing imaginable instead nuke planet orbit theyre clearly capable send grunts m rifles 
 isnt heinlein bad wwii movie one obvious points satire ever poked prodded combat scenes noisy repetitive ultimately tiresome 
 one scene journalist battlefield filimg soldiers slaughtered ends groaning predictability said cameraman gets skewered 
 soldiers commanders consistently idiotic 
 possess germ tactical intelligence even common sense 
 dont even behave like soldiers bad movie therefore dont care 
 hated tom berenger character platoon mattered therefore curious learn fate 
 dont even hate bugs whats hate 
hating like cursing hurricaine 
 theres anything really hateful movie doesnt know give us 
 screenwriter ed neumeier perhaps better appelation screen typist director increasingly talentimpaired paul verhoeven found way make characters story serve 
one subplots concerns woman pilot whos great getting tight situations 
 twice fine 
 fifth sixth time worn welcome 
theres never sense people really thinking way anything really tested show mettle 
also movie irritatingly selective effective bugs earthling weaponry 
 bug one humans screaming grasp five guys can stand around blast away full auto without damned thing 
 one human gets cornered lays waste whole platoons bugs one clip 
uhhuh 
 worst feature movie repulsive quasifascist flavor 
 say quasi movie uses many trappings fascism ot eroticize action gear uniforms etc movie doesnt nerve brains genuinely fascist intelligent subject 
 bumpers scenes apparently intended parody wartime recruitment propaganda propaganda just clumsy oafish wind making bugs look relatively innocuous comparison 
like rest movie 
theres suppose worth 
 acting bland neither arsenic gravy music disposable camerawork turgid 
 heartbreaking thing makes independence day look like masterpiece
