coming talented writer director cast mention one interesting film composers danny elfman civil action astoundingly emptyheaded drama one includes intriguing story somehow transforms admittedly tiresome occasionally even boring experience 
perhaps one major problems attempts relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian misplaced refreshing unconventional attitude absence magnetism even meaning 
watching film couldnt help notice similarities s far far superior film sweet hereafter dealt lawyer played brilliantly ian holm investigating school bus accident killed number children 
 attempts find someone may responsible accident holm interviews grieving parents well sole surviving passenger teenage girl starts remind teenage daughter young drugaddict run away home 
 plotting similar civil action also exact running time minutes 
considering amazing fulfilling truthful sweet hereafter concentrating school bus accident delving deeply ian holms character personal demons well teenage girl 
 civil action however idea running time went since film virtually two hours nothingness 
 get know parents well main characters 
 whole duration learn one thingnot one thingabout travoltas lawyer character jan schlictmann doesnt appear sort life purpose outside job 
every scene tediously related directly premise therefore one care root 
youve got work pretty hard actually get audience become involved parents plight since children dead exactly civil action 
 honest fairly hardpressed state aspect film actually liked 
aside one flashback mans young son died way doctor remained unmoved passive going scenes found mind wandering 
 say performances good whos fooling 
since every character onedimensionally written ones acting abilities challenged way

finally conclusion arrived end credits began role film left another question point 
abruptly ending without susceptible momentum none came begin civil action seemed least example make courtroom drama certainly justice serious subject matter film deals
