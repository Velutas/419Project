 arnie 
good role ok performance 
 think since getting little older held back lot stunts 
 thing disappointed fact nothing film 
 trailers looks like good scary action film ends boring long preposterous drama leads something else leaves us questions 
gabriel byrnes ironically played priest stigmata plays satan gives good performance seems held back character 
two years back al pacino gave terrific performance fun devils advocate seems like idea character also 
robin tunney great performance always plays satans main person wants impregnate carry child 
 course rod stieger gives another great performance really isnt nothing new 
 direction peter hyams times bit overblown though nearly visual style stigmata 
 given great camera work great scenes terrifically directed sadly just dont work movie 
 script written andrew marlowe witty lines movie style substance ending finale climax ready go home 
 things work performances writing visual style storyline finished product dont work well 
 sad thing end days many things going 
 plot organized action scenes brainy less mindnumbing 
 times seems like armageddon started get old tiresome 
hollywood running ideas bad like ive always said needs new ones 
even m budget end days less pleasing 
 fact m dollar budget least m easily m budget 
maybe sound crazy really looking forward new exorcist film hope make good original 
 need get new ideas stop recycling old ones just make money boxoffice

overblown effects stupid thin plotline good performances disappointing umm
