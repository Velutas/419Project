 last vampirefilms offers plenty blood gore beyond nothing 
jack crow james woods professional vampire slayer secretly working vatican 
 mens mission clean earth vampires 
 lost count many vampires slaughtered one always escaped 
valek thomas ian griffith dark messias ruler undead older time 
 eternity vampires searched salvation black cross 
 cross possesion vampires will able walk sunlight 
 either humans vampires will dominate earth 
 never liked john carpenter style 
 seeing film opinions changed 
john carpenter remains john carpenter 
however films selfirony black humour fascinating cinematography say greatest achievement long long time 
neither synopses carpenters direction original 
 things interesting 
 directors negative view catholic church instance 
 end film becomes clear cardinal alba maximilian schell simply used crow team find valek gain eternal life 
otherwise catholic priests shown cool drinking smoking breaking rool celibacy 
carpenter created interesting atmosphere 
set new mexican dessert switches bright golden sunrises bloody sundowns symbolically illustrating good evil light darkness 
 anything film simple illustration shows battle good evil 
 cinematography gary b kibbe probably films greatest achievement 
music composed john carpenter times effective special effects makeup likewise worth notice 
 comes cast intellectual film like casting last problem everyone can scream swing axe james woods suprisingly convincing 
 macho cool dedicated hunter lost family breed evil 
woods constantly overacting really saves film falling trap serious self importance 
daniel baldwin also entertaining crows loyal partner 
 cast members struggling 
 film doesnt take seriously stays afloat 
still like vampirefilms mediocre experience
