 u s army utilizes number books known field manuals stipulate specific way almost every action imaginable must done 
one particular field manual known fm among things covers practice saluting 
 saluting section subsection covers salute rendered military work detail presence superior officer 
 salute rendered highestranking individual present superior officer comes within six paces detail dropped officer passes six paces detail 
 event salute rendered man woman charge rather whole group 
almost beginning generals daughter see generals motorcade passing work detail 
everyone salutes 
 looked impressive just wasnt right 
 little bit showed someone either didnt appropriate research made conscious decision go style substance scene 
 fact serve metaphor rest picture seems director simon west tried hard craft film atmosphere flash forgot coherent story good characterization also crucial good movie 
 results film looks good like one scene just isnt right 
 first fifteen minutes film good example 
paul brenner john travolta agent armys criminal investigation division undercover georgia army base investigate illegal arms sale 
prior transaction buyer gets whiff brenner isnt unscrupulous supply sergeant hes supposed later night attempts kill shooting houseboat brenner living 
 ensues cat mouse action sequence ends like certain scene raiders lost ark well just say involves propellers 
brenner receives new orders commanding generals daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson found naked bound dead one bases training ranges 
 teamed rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe uncover truth peculiarly gruesome murder 
 want know whole action scene arms buyer even necessary 
 gives insight brenner fact hes little cocky 
 arms subplot turn later 
 add extra running time film 
 answer looked cool 
 atmosphere 
 beginning generals daughter presents us imagery deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors water backed bayouesque music 
nice immersion setting soon doesnt matter films plot shifts murder investigation entire mood 
 attention paid location story music altered fit generic thriller theme 
 filmmakers start thinking making different movie 
instead creating cohesive atmospheric theme entire film get distraction one theme followed another just director thought show countryside 
 examples also serve illustrate inconsistency another problem movie 
 ive already mentioned entire section film doesnt jibe rest characterization adds difficulty 
brenner comes across man little respect authority suddenly snaps presence general campbell james cromwell utters corniest yes sir s ive ever heard 
 even delivers emotioncharged monologue will work hard catch person killed generals daughter even though totally flippant whole thing just couple minutes previous 
sunhill initially comes across professional investigator utilizes couple blatantly illegal methods obtain information even revels ingenuity 
 characters protagonists hard get behind personalities place cases simply unappealing 
 imagine filming west shoot scene take actors aside tell lets time want 
 say although travolta stowe normally good film overact scenes 
 even worse offender clarence williams iii generals aide colonel fowler 
 swear guy says lines position attention 
 far cry days linc mod squad cant help think acting wests direction 
 couple side characters including west point psychologist john beasly young female private ariyan johnson make scenes nearly impossible bear 
 two actors seem escaped wests influence james woods provides good performance colonel moore elisabeths mentor psychological operations unit timothy hutton colonel kent military police 
woods relishes role man whose job playing peoples minds without ever taking top 
hutton just kind hangs around least wasnt overacting 
 havent read nelson demille novel movie based ill bet dollars story better book form 
 movie version got characters come go little nothing except fill space provide bits information seem neither mean anything terms advancing story reveal significance whole story finished 
every time presented new aspect case west gives us flash playing like momentous discovery ever information used investigators 
instead conclusions drawn tremendous leaps faith wonder successful investigations based facts lucky guesses instead 
 army saved time bringing brennan sunhill letting play game twenty questions suspects letting guess killer 
wouldve half hour 
 film finishes sort bookend featuring style southern scenery beginning 
literally closing credits get see brennan get car drive get see sunhill get car drive 
 seem kind happy 
maybe driving away simon west
