 film opens preacher running small africanamerican child town later moves hanging michael jackson impersonator ku klux klan jaunty musical number preceded remarks gays straights finally able put differences behind work together hate others jews 
 harmon merely trying point idiotic society can apologize harsh elements film presented mean spiritedly cant help feel like serious intent 
 entire central theme movie im afraid one just dont get 
 tried keep open mind watching homosexual elements just prevalent tastes 
 hard enough watch bash races sexes without preaching virtues homosexual accepted society 
 one expect accepted just guilty nonacceptance 
im prone judging anyone believe people free explore whatever avenues wish free scornful eye society dont force particular rhetoric throat arent going show respect preferences wish 
 maybe im missing satirical point harmon trying make think handled little tactfully 
 far musical comedies go isle lesbos trey parker matt stone musical good portion songs maddeningly catchy 
despite disturbing visuals mom apple pie stuck rest day 
speaking disturbing visuals wedding bells aint ringing decent song accompanying visuals spousal abuse harrowing film displaying 
 im lesbian touted press release particularly popular also pretty good good portion due stellar singing voice ms smith 
 mainly excellent vocals rating film based 
 performers decent save rosie odonnell like performance given danica sheridan 
 inherent problem character just singing voice leaves little desired 
one particular musical number lesbian rock one lowest points ever experienced filmgoing life thanks strained lackluster vocal job sheridan 
 film ends twenty minutes credits actually roll 
 remainder running time padded songs lesbian rock included ridiculously presented antinukes message tacked end reason make feature length film 
 isle lesbos reprise reached felt story already wrapped well enough end 
 film needlessly stretched past obvious end 
isle lesbos available videocassette www indieunderground com 
 transfer pretty clean detail wrinkled cloth paint backdrops readily apparent film letterboxed approximately 
 many respects isle lesbos incredible cult potential like rocky horror new millennium 
 film means cup tea know will enjoy 
 think might means seek 
 hand will cleansing palette good action film like gladiator 
wait arent gladiator films considered 
oh never mind
