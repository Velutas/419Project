 pretty impressive stars lost space just none happen actors 
 stars im referring computer generated ones make movies outer space stars less impressive actors hurtle thru try find way home 
yes terms acting star power 
 
 
well like falling star 
kinda pretty shortlived pretty much dead 
lost space really didnt know based s scifi television series name 
 year earths precious resources quickly usurped needs massive population 
john robinson william hurt scientist leading mission program colonize foreign planet 
earths entire existance contingent upon successful mission nobody whether johns family hired battle pilot don west matt leblanc seems enthusiastic leaving home planet several years 
johns family consists wife maureen mimi rogers atypical teenage daughter penny lacey chabert ingenious son will jack johnson beautiful scientist daughter judy heather graham 
despite everyones reluctance jupiter spacecraft abandons planet earth makes way vast eternity space 
unknown anyone audience evil doctor stowaway determined sabotage entire mission 
dr smith gary oldman hired group rebel conspirators turn expedition sour dr smith reprogrammed talking robot destroy robinson family 
 everything go wrong go wrong sides spaceship warped unknown destination now premise lost space complete 
 audience will likely lost boredom point wondering plot like jupiter will ever get ground 
 hard tell deserves blame incredibly bland corny characters horrifically lame script 
chabert basically one overdo sounding like whiny munchkin helium 
 like convinced commercials voice altered sort plot twist body taken aliens youre wrong 
thats just normal voice 
 yet another example friend faltering big screen leblanc incredibly dull yet obviously trying hard incredibly charming make sense makes want shove ass escape pod corridor without escape pod 
graham babe thank goodness something think film 
hurt black hole excitement sucks energy might left 
 hurt available tablet form prescription strength sleeping pill 
johnson isnt dull hes just lame young know winds saving everybodys ass time 
want example cool kid can 
 convinces robot think heart reconsider killing family 
hey dont laugh thing actually listened mr rogerswouldbeproud sentiment 
 alas thought character couldnt much worse rogers epitome generic mother known 
 hire actress 
 couldve white cardboard cutout word mom printed 
now wouldve pizzazz 
lost space luckily doesnt suffer every single category 
 special effects crisp clear least mildly captivating unlike presences onscreen save oldman plays evil character great deal fun finesse 
unfortunately oldman locked away film giving us nothing ample mocking opportunities enjoy 
 special effects pleasing eye nothing couldnt find modern scifi films 
contact example far exceeds film terms imagery imagination 
lost space just many shortcomings ever considered work cinematic art numerous contradictions time travel aspect horribly flawed wooden corny acting worse dialogue ending disappointing youd happier seen entire robinson family get blown smithereens 
 ending like film obvious sequel already considered 
 awful note end knowing year two 
 attempt family oriented commendable lost space lost illusion special effects nostalgia classic tv series revisited enough satisfy age groups 
well danger potential movie goers 
danger 
 movie crash lands without ever breaking thru atmosphere mediocrity
