 interest generous want start review scene liked meet joe black 
sir anthony hopkins playing superrich media mogul gathered family around dinner 
 oldest daughter played marcia gay harden millers crossing obsessively planning sinfully extravagant birthday party presents three superbly decorated little cakes supposed scale models big birthday cake 
 daughter asks hopkins pick one likes 
hopkins frustrated weight planning whole elaborate affair man position punts 
whichever one like dear says 
 daughter exactly woman position cries 
 liked scene two reasons 
first cakes looked really cool 
second perhaps scene movie people acted expect people act 
meet joe black chockfull odd performances people things discernible reason slow motion course three hours boot 
 easy watch meet joe black abundant eye candy palatial homes beauteous claire forlani even easier sleep right two people row managed quite nicely 
 difficult part movie understanding characters motivations someone thought three hours appropriate length overwrought mess 
 know audience problems movie thought comedy 
case point everyone know now brad pitt plays angel death movie 
however first see young lawyer coffee shop hitting glamorous claire forlani 
 clear movie whether need law degree become angel death makes certain kind sense 
 shouldnt take long observant moviegoer realize bad things happen mr pitt 
 indeed hideously prolonged sequence pitt looks shoulder retreating forlani forlani looks shoulder retreating pitt pitt walks road without looking suddenly gets squished 
well happened audience howled laughter continued laugh every comment remotely humorous 
 think sudden violent death sarcastic drawingroom humor funny encourage go see meet joe black immediately 
anyway deceased lawyers body worse wear massive injuries possessed angel death brad pitt takes role 
 idea death given pen name joe black disturb others wants take holiday experience world 
 werent hollywood might get interesting metaphysical discussion life death since get scene scene fishoutofwater humor just death george jungle crocodile dundee poor schmuck whos wandered jungle outback whatever doesnt know act society 
 also doesnt help character death written inconsistently 
 claims vacation never anything except hang around seriously attractive claire forlani just try get travel agent book one 
 speaks slow halting english perfectly fluent jamaican patois 
 knows everything characters nothing others 
 played brad pitt hes especially menacing charming glamorous intriguing hes just 
 someone told pitt never mind acting picture son just stand look pretty 
 pitt keanu reeves impression throughout movie 
ive used phrase angel death review deliberately contrast pitts performance years best angel performance nicolas cages city angels 
 pitt cold unfeeling cage warm empathetic situation allows 
 cage genuinely curious nature man pitt aloof arrogant 
cage struck instant chemical sparks costar meg ryan chemistry pitt forlani understandable accept notion forlanis character shallow cant see beyond pitts good looks 
 movies top name much better actor doesnt save meet joe black 
sir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material work unfortunately 
 plays one goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls exist hollywood 
 one wonders might happened made hopkinss character realistically evil 
hopkins marked death due bad ticker death steps grants extra time exchange guide world 
 course one can sure will act death taps shoulder 
 wonder movie long time wonder act similar situation especially multimillionaire 
hopkins pretty much goes office major subplot revolves around will control corporation 
fans corporate intrigue will fascinated im sure 
 stayed awake way meet joe black im asking 
movies death encourage live life fullest im going now 
go spend time family go volunteer local charity heck go take nap 
dont go see meet joe black will move three long hours closer death
