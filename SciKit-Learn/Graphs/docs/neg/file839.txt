 time 
 modern world cool rule hard imagine shakespeare becoming man 
 yet film film film based everlasting magic 
 warner brothers latest production shakespeare kicking ass rap beat magic intelligence slowly fades away 
though producers matrix vaguely based picture william shakespeares romeo juliet title sequence frightening rap song black limo making way dark streets new york hard associate shakespeares poetry 
 film takes place silent war two major mafia families city afro americans chinese 
 youngest son chinese mafia chieftain found murdered 
 afroamericans immediately suspected peace treaty signed two godfathers 
 point han romeo story finds brothers death 
escaping prison china returns united states avenge brothers fate 
 can restore justice kung fu kicks falls love mysterious beauty 
 problem daughter enemy 
theres weak echo shakespeares talent disappointing production 
 problems besides title 
 course dont call deformation great masterpiece 
 call modernization 
 seems producers fear audience will respond lyrics without car chases gun fights 
 lack respect audience find disturbing 
kenneth brannagh already proven shakespeare doesnt need updated tales grounded basics life human nature 
 long love hate honesty corruption exist everyone will understand embrace shakespeare 
 must admit found rome must die confusing 
 can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since first attempt directing 
 manages create incredible atmosphere directs firm precision 
unfortunately completely forgot character story developments 
 latest picture therefore visually impressive intellectually hollow 
 love story han jet li trish aalyah mafia intrigues undeveloped simplified 
jet li one amazing fighters ever hit silver screen aalyah magical voice 
 achievement save film completely braindead actors therefore can act 
 nothing two celebrities put together 
 actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry o dmx give standard mediocre performances 
delroy lindo one projects coherent image reality 
 theres acting worry 
even lis incredible skills martial arts action scenes though technically excellent long story updates simply embarrassing 
 make long story short romeo must die intelligent enough thriller sensual enough love story serious fun action film 
 certain bartkowiak much better o embarrassing completely unnecessary parallel romeo juliet film completely stuck sure 
 end nothing 
 performances worthy notice interesting character story surprises 
 good thing technical achievement 
 film can boast great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography well coordinated action sequences 
 music another factor prevents leaving theatre 
 mostly provided aalyahs enchanting voice several carefully inserted rap songs various artists create kind ghetto feel 
 think back much remember production 
 almost every summer movie interesting scenes moments remember associated massive special effects 
 film will get attention artistic qualities simply doesnt 
 someone never read shakespeare another popcorn film 
 us waste money time brain cells
