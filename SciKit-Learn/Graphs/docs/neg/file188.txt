 dull perfunctory uninspired boring 
 greater writer might created lyrical sentence adjectives flowing lovely arangements soaring metaphors 
 however rather cut chase 
 dull perfunctory uninspired boring 
 nothing glimpse depth shimmer intelligence insight 
 electricity scenes moment interest story subplots 
 underdeveloped features array bland characters played actors think theyre years boogie nights 
 wrong 
 picture assembled mark christopher 
based film dont know got job business 
 supposed amazing insight world dance club name originated s closed s 
 dont know film went production boogie nights released christopher managed plagiarize paul thomas andersons brilliant work every possible way framework plot style cinematography 
 lacks everything made boogie nights great depth intelligence energy fascinating characters challenging themes 
 cant even measure last days disco flawed still smart entertaining 
 remarkably bad timing id say release film tedious couple noteworthy pictures kind 
 exaggerated though one interesting character one terrific performance 
 character steve rubell played perceptiveness mike myers limp production deserves 
steve rubell owner studio christopher focused myers forced good film wreck 
alas instead guided endure trials young man named shane ryan phillippe goingnowhere new jersey teen gets job club thanks rubells homosexual impulses 
 meets friends array uninteresting characters coworker greg brecklin meyer wife anita salma hayek course love interest julie black neve campbell 
shane just innocent young fool beginning reasonably sturdy home life 
 scenes father border interesting heather matarazzo plays sister pushes phillippe screen 
 decides envelop disco scene succumb peer pressure drugs 
 friends push drugs never really explained fact friends questioned superficial ways greg gets really mad shane hes elevated bartender status 
 isnt single conflict takes center stage except shane kind unexplored reservation business works 
 film dumb dialogue inane 
theres scene late film shane confronts julie black next scene theyre arminarm without bit development 
 theyre kissing bowling alley 
 five minutes material thrown picture last minute well past onehour mark isnt long film begin 
campbell talented actress needs role gives little depth 
 one doesnt 
 phillippe almost presence whatsoever performance pales comparison mark whalbergs starmaking role boogie nights 
 seems dumb misguided voice never changes tone 
 guess picked color hair shape body seems pretty lanky 
hes wrong lead role doesnt help christopher forgotten develop characters 
 end shanes notable trait stupid fake accent 
 rest performances wasted 
hayek energetic talented young actress almost nothing 
meyer endearing allowed deeper cardboard 
 myers sheer force talent manages rise christophers wadingpool script 
rubell written just depthless rest characters myers good enough inject subtleties help round performance 
 fact myers sole reason see really make wish film revolved around 
ive read studio recreated last detail 
frankly dont care 
 easy recreate something technical like 
 fairly skilled production designer carpenters can manage task 
besides christopher keeps lights low sets invisible anyway 
aside myers performance complete failure 
 dull perfunctory uninspired boring 
 may find comparisons boogie nights unfair theyre obvious 
 event pallid without contrast 
 doesnt even work mindless entertainment shallow escapist viewers likely dismiss 
 dont forget key words dull perfunctory uninspired boring 
everything else said just padding
