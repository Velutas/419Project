 scene patch adams patch center courtroom surrounded people giving lively standing ovation strongworded attack group stoic doctors 
 noticed audience saw film reacting way realized going hard time finding someone agrees quality picture 
 see patch adams revolted beyond boundaries 
 hated movie every second sat watching actively hate now days later simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing memories 
 hate every element film beginning tom shadyacs shameless direction way misguided mishandled themes screenplay wants desperately convey 
 badness patch adams stupefying 
 confounding 
 cant believe film can bad 
 yet based real man probably good point make 
 film patch played undefeatable indefatigable robin williams performance insulting pathos sledgehammer sympathy wonder now even human 
 beginning film patch commits mental institution doesnt want kill 
 notices doctors dont care patients best way get patients treat like human beings 
 patch goes crusade great doctor actually talks patients 
 goes medical school meets truman daniel london convinces good help people 
 also meets carin fischer monica potters antimale med student just wants go motions successful doctor 
naturally dean medical school bob gunton hates patch wants thwart plans even though patch gets highest scores exams 
 patch decides hes going build free clinic middle nowhere help people problem may 
 friends synopsis easily abhorrent picture 
 superficial level film particularly bad wouldnt say cinematography bothered performances seem exactly shadyac aiming actually liked potters performance even wasted 
 film fails fundamentally execution 
every scene swells grand emotional music played maximum volume just get us cry real hard 
take instance first scene shows patch sitting bus 
 dont know patch yet theres sad music supposed make us really sad hes sad 
later patch makes lot progress helps dying patient peter coyote enjoy last days life music patch pushing patient recklessly halls hospital lively 
 patient finally dies spoiler alert music sad 
 problem music center emotions 
real drama characterbased 
 grow like someone something bad happens feel 
 dont ever grow know dying patient hes simply vehicle patchs greatness 
real drama doesnt seem forced present just make audience cry 
thats patch adams real drama 
 goes every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired overbearing sentimentality every scene 
even scenes little impact overall film drowning marc shaimans sickening musical score 
sentimentality like indeed bad 
 bad halfbaked simplistic themes 
 see patch really great student 
 aces tests without studying effectively people think hes cheating 
 patch doesnt think memorizing facts way become good doctor 
 dont see patients third year bursts every three seconds 
well patch might something fact need learn something go treating patients 
 everyone capability memorizing facts effort 
 us study 
 doctor really wants help doesnt know toe finger probably wont successful preventing death 
oh wait almost forgot point doctors just prevent death improve quality life 
yes 
 true 
 can without studying 
 can without going medical school 
 patch never seemed understand possibility maybe just maybe good idea study first talk patients later 
follow rules 
bah 
 needs rules 
 uptight doctors follow rules 
 real saviors ones running around hospitals big red spheres faces sporting baggy yellow pants 
 theres free clinic issue find shockingly frighteningly idealistic 
 free clinic 
 middle forest 
 patients can taken helped 
 free 
 will patients transported free clinic 
will emergency room 
 just mental patients 
 may ask will pay 
 film give token attempts question patchs motives think another character asks hes going pay addition little bit meaningless blather hmos medical insurance certainly dont explore challenge patchs ideas meaningful extent 
reader please understand making kind judgment real patch adams 
 know nothing 
 beliefs mirror film character might like intelligent discussion 
 regardless real patch adams believes themes put forth film simplistic phony 
 last scene big obligatory courtroom scene forced lunch halfway esophagus patch lot shouting 
actually robin williams lot shouting 
 shouts lot helping people lot people cry moved words 
 wont tell cant moved words moved words 
 moved profoundly negative way reminded cheap phony cinematic experience can 
patch adams cheapest
