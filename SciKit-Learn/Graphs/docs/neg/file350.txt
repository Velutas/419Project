old soldiers never die just turn cliches 
soldier film review michael redman copyright michael redman 
 warrior lover two personality aspects find difficult exist body 
jungian archetypes two opposites need create whole difficult integrate 
often well encounter lovers think everything just wonderful help jungs magician sit around imagining grand schemes 
without drive manifest plans much less wisdom recognize darkness dreams 
warriors hand ready go war drop hat will combat every last bit energy 
 dont care enough anything know whats worth fighting gladiators live battle 
 dichotomy describes individuals know can also illustrate societies 
america late sixties conflict old style cold warriors new hippie lovers 
todd kurt russell living breathing archetype 
chosen birth soldier raised government killing machine 
 childhood cruelty competition 
 indoctrinated big rules 
never question authority 
winning everything 
strength beats knowledge 
 veteran numerous intergalactic wars todd hes obsolete 
 new generation genetically engineered soldiers faster stronger 
left dead test battle best new killers caine jason scott lee hes unceremoniously dumped trash arcadia garbage world 
obviously hero still alive 
 finds group shipwrecked settlers abandoned planet nurse back health 
 peaceloving colonists get good look todd afraid exiled live amid junk environmentally hostile world 
 good guys 
 lovers find need warrior military coincidentally chooses world conduct exercises improved human weapons 
todd finds role protector 
 fascinating look roles played culture fears ultraright wing future ruined turning film cartoon 
 effects mostly secondrate explosions jerky slow motion 
 plot old hat 
 dont get even glimpse society created soldiers 
hardly anything makes sense 
 films science fares badly 
 remarkable advances weve made just years film takes place still stupid 
 conquering stars reason use vast amounts energy load huge space ships rubbish tote landfill light years away 
even stranger garbage barges appear double time machines 
virtually trash vintage 
 nothing story predictable 
 first thing todd sees coming back life sandra connie nielsen woman just little beautiful living harsh conditions taking care 
 doesnt take genius foresee husband isnt going around much longer 
 shock find films climax unarmed battle todd caine 
 guess wins 
 scenes work comedy 
todds first awakening human emotion comes glimpses connies nipple poking thin blouse 
later sits lonely campfire tear rolls dramatically lighted cheek slow motion 
supposedly clich isnt meant humorous 
dastardly col mekum jason isaacs pencilthin mustache real snidley whiplash 
responsible last years quirky visually enticing problematic fifth element director paul anderson sees film shane outer space 
maybe shane played sylvester stallone rambo mode 
 movie doesnt even work action film 
 never question outcome 
somehow new superior soldiers dont prove much match todd 
 acting isnt anything write home 
nielsen almost comes across real person soon relegated background victim 
russell buffedup credible job much challenge 
uttering around words film mostly todd hit things stare grimly space 
gary busey todds commanding officer completely wasted lowkey role 
everything blows occasionally looks cool 
sometimes sets impressive 
unfortunately occasionally sometimes dont make film 
 disappointing screenplay david webb peoples wrote blade runner possibly best science fiction movie ever made 
sharpeyed viewers will notice obscure references film 
peoples says blade runner sequel sidequel takes place universe 
although may intent original script result like bad television series blade runner replicants watch pass time 
perhaps artificial humans find entertaining 
 michael redman written column years wants wish everyone appropriate halloween whatever
