play bone newest addition ron sheltons sports themed repertoire fails numerous ways 
like sheltons great films bull durham white men cant jump dud unsuccessfully attempts use athleticism method connecting characters creating interesting subplots 
sheltons films considered sports films heavily revolve around specific game tell story 
shelton good past using sports analyze structure society collection films given examination different classes races living various different regions 
play bone unsuccessful boxing theme dull side story two guys girl travelling across country even worse 
 film social message like predecessors 
 relationship friends two failed boxers must face ring thousand dollars confusing number reasons 
 whole film since primarily buddy picture depends strength friendship two characters 
unfortunately weak bond reasons listed 
 never see cesar antonio banderas vince woody harrelson meet 
 two different scene odd friendship developed mandatory 
 vince cesar argue every moment possible trip las vegas 
 one convincing moment dedicated seeing characters laugh together actually agree something 
 third character trip grace lolita davidovich stands way 
 nearly every scene making impossible understand difficulty two male characters going fight 
 two many interfering irrelevant side stories 
vince convinced sees jesus regular basis cesar yells sky spanish angry grace tries sell inventions hotel owner robert wagner 
 boring tales hurt central plot 
 comes time two men fight dont even hesitate pound 
wasnt whole point road trip show two friends never hurt 
 time road trip part movie film wants 
shelton hand continues tell story 
forty five painful minutes remain 
 boxing scene cesar vince starts powerful interestingly different boxing movies 
however fight goes way long becomes repetitive predictable awhile kind like whole film
