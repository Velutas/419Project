anna king least fourth film adaptation margaret landons fact based novel king big expensive soulless 
though goodlooking lavish sets fancy costumes luscious cinematography can little compensate emotional wasteland peter krikes steve meersons script 
 much money spent pretty pictures forgot actually make movie interesting 
 jodie fosters first movie since jawdroppingly brilliant contact came two years ago isnt best choice show acting chops 
shes trapped stoic role anna leonowens uptight widowed british schoolteacher comes siam now thailand son instruct kings chow yunfat son ways west ways england ways world 
 king likes much puts charge educating whole royal family kids way impressive 
 eldest prince none happy father offended way 
 punish imperialist schoolteacher soon gets know anna stern motherwholovesyou personality better comes like 
meanwhile siam comes attack neighboring british colony burma 
 king close advisors suspect britains arouses suspicion siam putting anna uncomfortable position 
 sure make seems suspect british involvement crisis works diffuse kings prejudices 
 though selfrighteous ever cant help influenced eloquent anna slowly quietly develop affections 
 scene middle anna king one kings younger daughters dies 
 classic deathbed scene girls mournful eyes staring father tries semi successfully maintain composure 
anna comes cries bit 
 sequence purpose evoke strong emotional response viewer 
im usually sucker scenes yet time just sitting emotions untouched 
 remains true movie remains emotionally barren 
 never develop connections characters never given reason care 
 ludicrously long epic directed andy tennant whose last film ever one favorites 
 doubt tennants ability put together decent movie anna king aside psychologically inept also technologically deficient 
 sets scenery gorgeous camerawork nothing convey grandeur 
even terrence malick managed flora fauna otherwise abysmal thin red line tennant can muster million worth props shoot malaysia 
 feel like camera restricted immediate point view wide tracking shots sweeping zooms fill us largerthanlife awe 
 liked foster yunfat give entertaining terribly involving performances two lead roles 
fosters generally stoic persona serves well playing reserved formal rather underdeveloped character 
yunfat especially effective perfectly conveying king siams sangfroid permeated violent outbursts 
 anna king inability involve viewer characters situations 
 cast great director talented budget lavish illadvised remake classic rogers hammerstein movie unable utilize things form compelling whole 
 emotionless costume epic
