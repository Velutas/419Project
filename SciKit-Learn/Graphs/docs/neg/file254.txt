hey ive got great idea movie 
ok well get tim allen pull angry faces two hours 
whats 
sounds boring 
ok still tim allen pull faces two hours half angry looks half im pain 
looks 
whats 
 still doesnt sound funny 
 ewwwww 
looks 
still funny 
 answered doesnt sound funny ding ding ding 
youre absolutely correct 
 richer poorer moronic farce rich married couple played tim allen kirstie alley seek refuge amish community bumbling accountant wayne knight best know newman tvs seinfeld gets trouble tax evasion 
 ensues badly scripted horribly directed minutes cinema hell 
 makes wrong nobody seems film needs 
 
 
namely talent 
backing married couple brad caroline sexton allen alley popular snobby duo seem totally love everyone else reality brink divorce 
just marriage seems hanging final thread brad discovers accountant bob lachman knight engaging illegitimate deals sextons names 
 irs catches since everything points back sextons lachman nothing much 
 
 
except run away join amish community 
first time screenwriters jana howington steve lukanic give us couple chuckleoutloud moments even decent laughs way much cringe horribly made film youll likely miss laughs regurgitating popcorn 
alley absolutely unwatchable chemistry allen believable chemistry homework tenth grade inform total b s 
allen alley way convincing tycoons convincing amish couple 
 entire movie one bad illconceived notion curtailed beginning 
 amish movie also flimsy unconvincing 
 trite stereotypical script imagine actors cast noticing theyre predominantly tv figures probably ones get 
bryan spicers directing doesnt help one bit either 
 fact listing spicers filmography includes first power rangers movie big screen adaption mchales navy insult r sum 
now ive pretty much run richer poorer ground will let best thing 
 bumped seven films notch worst movie list 
thats right thanks film ranking number years worst six films now seemingly bad smile like previously inhabiting number ten spot now doesnt suffer ridicule making bottom ten list 
 look respect richer poorer will end making someone happy
