 walt disney pictures announced liveaction feature based s cartoon series mr magoo special interests groups representing visionimpaired let cry dismay 
mr 
magoo claimed insult men women represented 
 fact wrong 
mr 
magoo just insult blind nearblind insult every human misfortune suffer dreadfully unfunny minute atrocity 
 stating obvious remark disney appears run original ideas 
look roster releases youll see shocking list retreads including dalmatians george jungle junglejungle darn cat flubber now mr 
magoo 
 best george jungle mildly entertaining 
 worst mr 
magoo exposes just painful bad movie experience can 
 first problem mr 
magoo script 
despite collaboration naked gun scribe pat proft mr 
magoo comically barren 
 beginning end theres laugh found 
every attempt humor lots falls flat audible thud 
youd think dozens gags jammed film least work thats case 
ive laughs ingmar bergman pictures 
 theres leslie nielsen looks sounds acts absolutely nothing like animated character memorably voiced jim backus 
 past nielsen proven comic aptitude roles movies like airplane naked gun 
lately however getting lazy taking parts likes dracula dead loving spy hard mr 
magoo 
even nielsen top form take incredible stretch imagination see magoo especially since reminded original short cartoon segments open close film top form phrase use describe performance 
 strictly takethemoneyand run operation 
 story like many disney stories can described one long sentence magoo witness theft rare jewel museum trying apprehend thieves police mistake robber 
 cops played ernie hudson stephen tobolowsky take lumps early often 
 bad guys kelly lynch lot martial artstype kicking nick chinlund malcolm mcdowell good sense look embarrassed 
matt keeslar portrays one magoos sidekicks nephew waldo 
 bumbling mans interesting companion dog named angus 
 mr 
magoos humor comes form failed slapstick 
 cartoon violence level film doesnt approach home alone flubber still pretty acute characters getting hit head sledgehammers knocked snowy precipices 
theres nonviolent bit magoo preparing chicken dinner funny handled better compared mr beans recent similar misadventure doesnt hold well 
 series lame jokes result magoos near blindness occasion mistakes wild animal baby 
im willing cut director stanley tong little slack 
tong hong kong film maker trying break hollywood market helmed several jackie chan movies including first strike rumble bronx supercop 
 chief talent choreographing martial arts fights wasted despite high kicking kelly lynch 
like john woo hard target ringo lam maximum risk appears tong consigned purgatory making bad movie entry american mainstream 
 worth noting unlike many disney films hold perverse appeal crowd driving parents distraction mr 
magoo appears bore viewers ages 
 screening attended walltowall kids part didnt seem enjoying 
 film asked one little girl thought 
 pained expression confirmed adage picture can indeed worth thousand words 
mr 
magoo kind movie rejected potential viewer sight unseen
