 almost amusing watch year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed sally potters followup s tango lesson man cried 
 geny actress cold stare big black eyes appeared impressive range films doesnt even come close bold heroine film set historical backdrop world war requires 
ricci whose character shockingly silent blank showing occasional smile hint concern shares scenes astounding cate blanchett quite amusing sight behold 
blanchetts lola paris dwelling dancer befriends aspiring singer suzie bold interesting layered everything heroine lacks 
costar upcoming lord rings trilogy blanchett good seven inches ricci sports twice makeup dons flashy wardrobe 
 actress inhabits role always remarkably fervor life makes want hold screen films lead rather dull companion 
important historical events involving hitler nazis scatter across film landmarks serve films little conflict 
obviously tables turned life suzie events whose jewish origin unknown among parisian colleagues 
 man cried many aspirations none come full circle films close 
 forced messages go forward always go forward lola preaches suzie theres romance suzie fellow target hitlers nazis gypsy cesar johnny depp like ricci barely gets speak lola struggles character desires things wealth men core devices lies suzies desire travel america father journeyed leaving mother years ago 
 films main problem potter isnt skilled enough tell epicsized story suzie 
 time periods instability conflicting social classes prejudice suzie around new life serving writer director potter throws hardly inch depth found 
 time sighinducing climax hits believability complete absence focus leave one ready leave theater 
 films falling action weirdly unsatisfying unlikely really meant believe happen 
contrastingly moving final scene man cried strikes note made effective ties emotional beginning film 
although apparent potter cant grasp reaches im puzzled reaches much first place 
riccis suzie meant films core extended flashback films beginning quickly drawn ending everything seen film way relates 
 potter spend much time subplots involving individuals 
 character suzie present man cried work ensemble present enough film riccis 
 almost constant lack flow onenote tone potter depicts man cried somewhat improved upon sacha viernys beautiful cinematography renders films various locations wonderfully 
also worthy note lindy hemmings costumes help depict area quite nicely 
 theres music 
 minute one minute ninetyseven theres hardly moment wavering skilled voice opera singer rhythms gypsy music dont undercut action notes stricken overwhelm particularly john turturro portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio whose money reputation catch lolas interest accompany oftentimes perfect chords captured undermine state films characters reinforce state 
potter obviously cares much every musical note unfortunately effort isnt given towards almost everything else
