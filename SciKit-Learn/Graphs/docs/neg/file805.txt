 directoral debut gary oldman chose highly personal family drama violent alcoholic husband father various lives affects 
 characters places events may special meaning writerdirector audience left dark 
 center tale abusive raymond ray winstone film focuses people orbit around 
 spends days hanging friends pubs girlie bars 
 returns home pregnant wife valerie kathy burke fiveyearold daughter 
raymond demonstrates violent tendencies paranoid delusions early accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles stealing 
raymond proceed beat bite bloody wreck 
 least billys problems 
billy heroin addict downturn doesnt seem hell last much longer 
billy valeries mother janet laila morse raymonds nemesis 
 disapproves powerless anything 
 merely struggles hoping children will survive respective torments 
 description seems bleak havent told half 
 cheery movie time downright depressing 
 times interesting watch see just makes raymond tick one ever simply calls cops end quite worth 
 many scenes randomly dot picture little purpose 
take example extended sequence one billys scuzzy friends defends stray puppy 
 film filled character moments never really achieve anything 
granted genuinely powerful sickening moments film expression seems catharsis creator us 
 actors fine job particularly central roles 
 good thing actor turned writer oldman knows write good scenes actors nil mouth meat can tear 
 bad thing actor turned director theres one restrain oldman making poor choices 
 good character drama mean something involved making film audience 
oldman got half right
