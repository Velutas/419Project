tim robbins martin lawernce team road movie comedy 
robbins plays exec discovers wife sex boss 
 goes depression drives around neighbourhood arrives inside usual ghetto side every american city 
 lawernce attempts steal car avail dragged along robbins trip arizona 
 hold store mistaken two robbers just like cousin vinny chased police robbers 
 course theres gags along way usually lawernce 
although film midly funny quite watchable theres something horribly familiar 
 film really called beverly hills midnight run theres lawernce wisecracking heavy profanity just like eddie murphy beverly hills cop pratically idea midnight run 
 full road movie cliches even comedy car chase just seemed eighties 
even credit sequence seemed steve martin chevy chase eighties comedy 
 also isnt much chemistry robbins lawernce 
 planes trains automobiles real chemistry steve martin john candy 
 nothing lose hardly chemistry 
towards end chemistry seems work bulk film hardly 
 director directs film workman like fashion gets jokes across 
 although chemistry two leads give good performances 
lawerence gives good eddie murphy performance robbins alright aswell 
however robbins performance nowhere near good characters played jacobs ladder player 
 fact want see robbins comedy much better nothing lose suggest rent hudsucker proxy much funnier 
nothing lose funny moments however 
 humour isnt particulary sophisticated enojyed dumb dumber might enjoy 
 characters arizona funny theres also good scene robbins asks shopkeeper threatening approach better lawerences consisted lawerence threatening shoot shopkeepers ass swearing lot himselfs speaking deep scary voice gags predictable lack chemistry infurating ending farfetched perfect 
nothing lose robbins first bad movie hopefully last suggests odereick twice making another film 
 nearly ruined carreys career ace ventura nature calls lets hope hasnt ruined robbins even lawerences nothing lose
