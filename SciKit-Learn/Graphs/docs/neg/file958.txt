recently one night young director named baz luhrmann couldnt sleep 
 tumbled bed moved television watched mtv hour 
 moved kitchen spent amount time eating spoiled food 
 took volume shakespeares work read cover cover never really paying attention words plot 
 climax took video camera pressed button 
 result 
william shakespeares romeo juliet worst film ever made complete failure 
though fair interesting complete failure 
 idea films core make shakespeare appealing crowds 
 done moving camera around rapid rate cant see going 
 filming dialogue voice 
 shooting leonardo dicaprio like calvin klein model 
 making frame go still flashing characters name bottom 
 filming long tedious action sequences slow motion 
 mean man s dude 
however ive seen terrible films fun watch 
 examples batman robin island doctor moreau 
 rule doesnt apply 
 film takes seriously 
 major fault 
another problem pointed friend alex singing songs leonard bernstein throughout 
 original play powerful piece work author remained neutral didnt take sides 
 clear supposed side romeo 
 just look way film 
 begining hes hero doesnt work 
 dicaprios awful performance doesnt help 
luhrmann never decides wants entertain us enlighten us 
 result mess 
 can feel striving something isnt 
 tries pull mix drag queens filmed purposefully arty angles 
 tries hard 
key word tries 
 oh look hes filming water action 
pretty 
 represent 
 people ugly things 
 scrambled away tv set feeling guilty never read play keep straight face
