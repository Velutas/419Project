dear god fantastically bad film 
regardless say knock cant grasp awfulness words 
 see experience 
heres kicker though suggest 
yes bad film easily one incompetent films year certain misguided charm makes unique kind disaster endure 
 fact enjoyed brief running time despite dreadful acting completely incomprehensible story 
dont get wrong im excusing knock 
 reaches unacceptable level badness incoherent wonder hacked worse avengers 
 also features truly terrible performances lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino course jeanclaude van damme 
 however entertaining presence rob schneider excessively inventive pretentious direction tsui hark 
 watched occasionally wondered aware awfulness 
now retrospect seems clear wasnt still fascinating kind mess 
 dont like writing plot descriptions far boring part writing review case im hook way write accurate synopsis knock 
 sake comparison trouble understanding usual suspects first viewing 
 paid closer attention knock thing able say van damme plays dude named ray accused cia think selling knock products knock products course products look like namebrand materials generic cheap 
 dont know martial arts lots martial arts film 
ray good martial arts beat bad guys theres problem 
rob schneider plays sidekick although idea really end film 
lela rochon just woman accuses stuff paul sorvino good guy bad guy 
 fact every character goes many shifts good bad end provides absolutely insight really 
 order knock completely incoherent makes absolutely sense 
 strange mess 
 written stephen e de souza also wrote die hard hours 
can man 
 dont see unless course huge chunks film removed sake running time 
knock seems interesting premise far action films go theres semblance 
 instance van damme introduced seconds later hes running chariot race streets hong kong 
 
 knows 
 implications 
 idea 
 action films abandon depth favor action normally problem 
knock however first film preferred see talky sequences cut 
 acting embarrassingly bad rochon particular delivers lines stiff talentless insincerity 
sorvino addition deserves better 
van damme bad hes charming bad way cant say hes hard watch although rarely understood saying 
 exception rob schneider actually quite funny lot time 
tsui utilizes many tricks makes john woo look tame comparison 
theyre pointless gimmicks though shots innerworkings knock running shoe 
 action scenes never boring one particular piece inside fruit factory fruit factory wellchoreographed 
lots scenes pitched well comedy heroes first encounter rochon character 
 tsui know film beyond ludicrous 
 hope alternative frightening thought 
knock feel truly terrible exercise camp mania 
 boring id give zero stars 
 boring loud excessive completely incoherent 
 also funny even isnt meaning funny 
 bad film succeeds entertainment doesnt deserve fully lambasted 
 recognize knock irrefutable badness cant deny zany useless charm 
oh know theyre just action scenes looking desperately real story theyre fun action scenes amongst crowd laughably inane concepts 
 fun admire awfulness film like doesnt excuse fact indeed awful
