synopsis easilyangered chainsmoking architect david encounters homicidal first wife diedre five years divorce 
diedre easily cons davids notsobright new wife molly believing shes child psychologist can influence molly davids quicktempered son michael 
diedre time murders bunch people 
comments ex bad movie 
 havent seen turkey magnitude quite 
 kept vacillating however giving ex one star sheer awfulness three stars campy humor ultimately decided split difference give two stars 
 summarized briefly synopsis yet another spurnedpsycholovergetsherrevenge type movie 
im sure many films produced since fatal attraction use tired storyline seems like 
 ex however though following many standard cliches thriller subgenre differs slightly norm least doesnt take seriously like many duds malicious stalked two examples come mind 
 involved movie realize theyre turkey apparently turn hammy performances compliment ludicrous dialogue contained within script 
 exs storyline said incorporates many cliches predominant films nature however plot overwrought unbelievable viewer must accept logic operate realm movie 
diedre davids first wife kills kills kills example without ever worry police investigations like though shes bright enough leave fingerprints scene crime 
david new wife molly incredibly difficult time understanding michael son emotional problems specifically inability control anger 
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come blows people every minute movie connection son made 
molly easily swayed diedre believing shes child psychologist allows demented woman spend time son 
time time things add movie 
 viewer cant accept fact will definately like ex 
 hand can appreciate movie campiness hell probably like much better 
 dont mean necessarily suggest however ex memorable exercise camp 
even viewed itssobaditsgood angle movie isnt successful 
 ex moments though almost involve yancy butler psychotic diedre nick mancuso david 
 two actors turn decidedly hammy performances oftentimes elicit chuckles audience 
 truly awful lines written help humor along 
butler gets larger portion bad dialogue every time character kills someone punchline thats unbelievably inane 
 murders tenant apartment wishes use spy david example diedre whacks elderly lady crowbar states im sorry lease terminated 
 diedre takes therapist another ridiculous scene 
 diedres therapist wishes recommitted decides visit diedre alone new apartment never realizing course 
therapists typically catatonically braindead movies 
 successfully snuffed woman diedre looks body says always said end session dr jones 
oh thats right 
im sorry time 
 passes humor film 
 audience doesnt necessarily laugh groan type groan suggests audience cant believe theyre watching crap although watching 
nick mancusos chainsmoking nervouswreck character cheesy lines butlers character delivers ridiculously overdone performance provides better comic relief 
 drags cigarette instance one movies best scenes david tries explain lawyer creep exwife 
 exaggerated exasperation nearly shouts woman cuckoobird 
 trust funny context 
 movie continues painfully obvious conclusion 
 wont reveal ending specifically though anyone remotely familiar thrillers type probably guess ending just film review will say ex one biggest fire hazards appearing recently film 
molly david cabin becomes engulfed flames approximately three seconds 
molly one point film notsobrilliantly observes discovering diedre moved apartment across familys spy upon shes crazy 
youd pretty crazy youd rented turkey 
id avoid unless tv come across 
 may want watch groan bad punchlines stupid plot feel good didnt spend money renting
