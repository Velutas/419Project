around end japanese cartoon came usa television really wasnt big 
 fact many people even knew pokemon hit big kids adults alike became one biggest franchises merchandise seller time 
 fact even spawned big screen adventure pokemon first movie wasnt bad 
 grossed million opening weekend went make almost million 
fans thought great now second movie pokemon craze pokemon movie far inferior original animated movie 
first plot really isnt much fact plot bad guy trying destroy ancient never seen pokemon lugia except fact ash kethcum worlds best pokemon trainer must try stop destroys one pokemon forever 
well go course ash followed friends misty brock gary pokemon friends pikachu squirtle charizard usual 
even though first movie wasnt great film definately enjoyable wellmade movie actual thin storyline 
 new movie however nothing garbage nothing good storywise good thing comes plush animation colors 
compared first film movie awfully bland opening titles end titles tries best work fails miserably every corner 
 characters dimensional story thin chicken broth writing lame 
even called action scenes extremely lame falls even gets chance go 
 voices even arent good almost feels like stars dont want like can tell extremel bad movie 
 certainly 
 film one thing going animation although disney standards still good interesting cgis colorful animation colors jump fast seem nicely put film 
 film bad got good treatment animation still question answered hopefully pokemon next year will much better trash 
 now watch first one 
 much much better
