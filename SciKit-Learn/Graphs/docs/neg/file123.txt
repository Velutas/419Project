 respecting director must also respect fact perfect 
woody allen made couple lessthan good films hes favorite 
even martin scorsese hasnt perfect track record 
kevin smith smashing debut classic clerks stooped low sellout make dreadful mallrats 
 mean far director whos made several films none bad richard linklater slacker dazed confused sunrise suburbia 
 great 
now adore quentin tarantino 
 first two films classic films second one one greatest films time 
 just wasnt good year 
 made way many tv appearances 
 mispronounced jackie chans name mtv movie awards 
 made film 
 also awarded oscar guess grand exception 
robert rodriguez also great director brilliant one cool one 
ive never seen alexandre rockwell allison anders film cant comment 
 crap ensemble directors film four give pitiful efforts 
pitiful director 
now fairness ensemble director pieces never really work 
ive never seen new york stories heard first two films scorsese francis ford coppola crap saw woodys one hilarious totally par will rate film individually report back overal average score film 
exposition simple one bellhop ted totally overdone tim roth whos god one though couple good moments working new years eve first shift old fancy hotel 
hes one couple rooms yet 
 old bellhop seemingly immortal marc lawrence hated pulp fiction actually hands cap ted goes job happily 
 night goes becomes increasingly annoyed hostile 
yea 
 short films presented order btw 
 missing ingredient writerdirector allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt 
 one starts horribly plot intrigue crap dialogue 
 situation terrible physically painful watch 
 plot something coven witches needing sperm bring back godess gasp 
stuck inside object hotel room 
 witch supposed bring ione skye calls ted asks can perform fellatio get 
yeah thats said 
stupid plot inane characters arent interesting etc etc etc good thing good cast turn wastes pitifully 
 even actually funny second 
 rating stars 
 wrong man writerdirector alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals laurence bender 
another bad little film another stupid sex thing going 
ted stumbles wrong room something gets middle couple david proval jennifer beals attempt coming back playing sex games 
ted tries escape cheer will end soon 
 least bit comedy just much 
 david proval never overacted much 
 pulp fiction producer laurence bender gets puke window 
 masterpiece compared first one still 
 misbehavers writerdirector robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek 
 robert rodriguez film without salma hayeks navel 
nope 
luckily shes tv dancing get see 
surprisingly enough read screenplay year actually seeing one seemed potential 
 fastpaced funny well funny 
 watched seemed anticlimactic seemed gain momentum towards end everything happened 
antonio overacts nicely two kids lana danny funny 
 said moves slowly way painful funny 
 ending stupid funny time 
oh 
 plot antonio supposed gangster assumed really leaves two troubling kids home wife tomita go get drunk new years party 
antonio hires ted couple bucks watch kids night long things go wrong 
 okay 
 man hollywood writerdirector quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon jennifer beals 
ironically one considered best bad reason best represents quentin done film 
 plays chester spoiled brat actor something just huge boxoffice hit hands living playing anticlimactic game hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen peter lorre gamble see one can get light lighter ten times row 
theyre drunk need sober nervous ted hold cleaver bring lighter doesnt light 
 also pay lot cash 
 much exactly little film campy 
tim roth probably payed lot money stupid part stupid film made bunch people high cause theyve hits major minor 
 took quentin realize 
 thing doesnt seem like realizes 
 id give good stars 
 sucked 
 anticlimactic dialogue wasnt good 
 starts long steadicam shot goes flashes 
 makes sense 
 cool makes uneven 
 long just good 
hopefully quentin never repeats one 
conclusion whats moral 
 youve made celebrated films dont ensemble piece 
 rewatched new york stories stopped tracks 
none point theyre embarrassing writerdirectors actors cause theyre working crap 
 will forgive everyone involved especially look forward quentins next directing job even though rodriguez jumped back top immeadiately cool dusk till dawn found exhilerating 
 love quentin suppose good made man hollywood makes seem realistic god cinema 
 seem respect directors arent gods actually human beings make mistakes 
 man hollywood big mistake lets hope doesnt return continuously
