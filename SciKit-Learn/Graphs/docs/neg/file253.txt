battlefield long boring just plain stupid 
battlefield earth 
 film review michael redman copyright michael redman 
 midteen years horrendous reoccurring nightmare 
behind wheel car driving straight road middle desert 
 scenery except horizon line converging parallel lines highway 
 matter view didnt change travelling getting anywhere 
 time awoke sweat terrified 
 dont carl jung understand dream 
powerless make changes trapped boring situation hope rescue stuff nightmares whether asleep awake 
 exactly will feel minutes battlefield earth begins 
 flash style l ron hubbards science fiction epic earliest best entry dullest summer film 
dull stupid 
 year psychlo aliens ruled planet years 
humans either work slave labor mining operations live barbarians 
theres hope 
 future bleak 
 psychlo make mistake capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler barry pepper organizes revolution chief security terl john travolta alien race 
 archetypal postapocalyptic plot full promise 
considering talent involved millions thrown screen difficult see failed miserably 
 
 story full holes falls apart within minutes opening credits 
 really supposed believe millennium looking gold psychlo never discovered fort knox 
 fighter planes still pristine condition time gassed 
 cavemen become expert pilots seven days can easily advanced alien ships 
 psychlo spy cameras somehow dont notice slaves missing days 
travolta prances across screen hamming hes worth almost entertaining 
almost 
 rest actors wooden mannequins trying laugh delivering lines person mananimal ever utter 
 film looks good also looks familiar 
 race large hulking apelike creatures taken world cities lie ruin 
sound like something charlton heston might 
 psychlo look like overweight klingons gear dune 
 final air battle air force fighters psychlo ships hightech city something george lucas might associated 
 loud 
 oppressive 
 slow 
 long far 
 long 
 goes 
 list problems battlefield earth endless 
 difficult find anything film work 
oh yeah 
 color scheme nice 
 real question movie ever got made 
 something fact l ron hubbard founder scientology 
 john travolta member church 
 might explain travolta bought rights novel years ago 
 doesnt give us clue firsttime screenwriter corey mandells atrocious script used 
 highprofile project entrusted roger christian never directed major film 
 one looked thing released realized might problems 
 one bright spot longer will kevin costners postman begrudgingly admit guilty pleasure big budget science fiction failure 
 battlefield earth honor sewed 
often reviewers will recommend skip mediocre films wait video 
thats case 
 can act now make decision see big screen small one 
dont hesitate 
strike now iron cold
