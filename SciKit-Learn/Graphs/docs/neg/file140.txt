 snake eyes dog youd put sleep 
 couch youd put sidewalk sit week 
 child youd reading military school catalogs 
 ship wouldnt titanic imply glamor tragedy exxon valdez 
 personal side note saw movie road houston business trip 
 whatever reason hotels cable system wasnt showing astrosbraves game featured randy johnsongreg maddux matchup 
 forced pay full price snake eyes instead watching perfectly good baseball game free invective deserved seen perspective 
snake eyes supposed mystery movie good mystery movies supposed leave asking questions way theater 
snake eyes good mystery movie questions wheres manager get readmit pass 
 fall asleep drive home wreck rentacar can sue brian de palma 
 late academy revoke nicolas cages oscar 
will someone please im begging give gary sinise role worthy talents 
 exactly cage end wearing exact shirt tie sinise 
 first glaringly wrong thing snake eyes trailer 
 youve seen trailer without seeing movie consider fortunate 
 trailer work sheer genius 
 manages convey everything worthy movie noteworthy steadicam work exuberance cages performance thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman essential elements marginal plot 
 expert craftsman pieced together fairly good trailer snippets wretched movie deserves praise percentage gross 
 best trailer category oscars farfetched 
 set us overwhelmingly disappointing movie 
 trailer sets promising plot detective ricky santoro cage must solve mystery shot secretary defense atlantic city payperview boxing match 
unfortunately multiple problems afoot 
 trailer gives away much much story 
 shooter killed instantly story revolves around secretary killed involved conspiracy 
 films secret hohum best anyone watched trailer aware law economy characters can figure top conspirator 
without interesting plot without interesting dialogue without much reason care characters story snake eyes failure almost every possible level 
 much hated movie must give brian de palma one tiny bit credit 
de palma maddeningly inconsistent 
 can day create amazingly welldone movies untouchables carlitos way 
 offdays can well just horrid bonfire vanities raising cain 
snake eyes falls horrid category couple moments worth seeing strictly filmschool degreeofdifficulty value 
 steadicam opening scene good job introducing cage character virtuoso technical job director actor 
 splitscreen chase scene looks pretty good followed gods eye view bank hotel rooms thats imaginitively done 
 whats called giving devil due 
 technical skill doesnt even come close making sheer evil movie 
placing plot holes one side moment snake eyes features easily worst boxing match cinema history george foreman better shape movie boxers hurricane exists reason punctuate significant plotlines portentuous thunderclaps perhaps worst overly drawn ending years 
snake eyes criminal act evil waste time talent 
cage sinise yes even de palma deserve better 
 audience deserves better refund readmit pass free popcorn coupon can ever restore us time weve spent wash awful images mind 
however left one consolation warned movies title snake eyes nothing roll craps
