retrospective city living dead 
 film review mike watson copyright mike watson 
 heard someone describe films italian schlock horror director lucio fulci dimwitted 
 golly just words fail confronted dog like city living dead 
although late fulci managed rather good thrillers career one 
two points movies favour impressive camerawork sergio salvati occasionally evocative score fabio frizzi keep things falling totally abyss large city living dead failure 
 like cinematic failures comes bad writing dumb performances lousy direction 
 story starts new york seance medium katherine mccoll sees vision priest hanging town dunwich massachusetts 
 reasons wont go opens gates hell must closed saints day dead will rise walk earth 
 medium apparently dies fright seance awakens coffin graveyard next day rescued crusty old journalist christopher george 
 scene howler bust open coffin large pick axe know someone alive inside 
 dont cadavers various things stuffed drained theyre buried 
anyway two go dunwich save world various grisly goingson already happening saints day approaches 
fulcis graphic gore evidence serves highlight films flimsy script plodding direction 
 dialogue manner speaking unspeakable 
 bad quotable sense like ed wood film bad sheer dullness blatantly obvious lets explain plot type approach 
mccoll doesnt clue character deadly serious one minute frivolous next times genuinely hard watch 
 geezer actors name escapes plays town psychiatrist becomes even harder stomach mccoll film progresses 
christopher georges performance salvageable gets brains ripped end zombie dont care 
 fact dont care anyone city living dead though fulci films hasnt mattered much form stylist ideas man beyond 
 director fulci idiosyncrasies incredibly silly annoying 
 constantly uses extreme closeups peoples eyes ridiculous technique suggests attempt convey emotion dialogue actors arent capable 
 despite gruesome violence barely manages single scare entire film 
longtime collaborator fabio frizzi talented always erratic offers patchy soundtrack veers eerie gothic death marches woefully inappropriate electropop thats quite frankly embarrassing 
fulcis films period may flawed house cemetery beyond black cat nonetheless films inspiration atmosphere better dialogue turkey 
 completists
