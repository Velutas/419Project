 married two move states quickly thereafter get divorce 
 point hedwig starts writing music meets another confused boy soon turns star 
 boy also turns back hedwig isnt long hedwig puts together hisher band tours states via seafood restaurants 
 story hisher life told via flashbacks musical numbers 
critique artsyfartsy musical great songs superb performance john cameron mitchell doesnt really come together whole overthetop symbolism incoherence much pretension retain interest whole way 
 fact isnt much realistic articulate behindthescenes look rise rock n roll star ambiguous overly poetic incomprehensible struggle man sexuality identity whole person planet 
 guess expecting former going 
 film somewhat interesting point personally never able involve much basic symbolic incongruent nature film left feeling cold distant 
 definitely tuned certain type audience 
chances fan wall rocky horror picture show even priscilla queen desert elements tangled movie will likely strike fancy characters film even ask audience sing along point provide lyrics song onscreen 
well personally dont care films didnt really get whole show atmosphere movie either 
 guess mightve looked literally like said earlier just didnt care enough characters delve butterfly represents freedom 
side things 
 know film left many questions unanswered didnt make feel fulfilled 
 hedwigs relationship member band beard 
 happened hedwig tommy gnosis end movie 
 actual sequence fantasy 
 ever happened lawsuit 
 
 part film interested somewhat 
 idea behind film main character uncover hisher sexuality thats one thing many relationships situations presented movie wanted resolution pieces well 
 didnt get 
 films humor also didnt tickle funny bone either 
 ive seen many film arthouse theatres patrons rolling aisles laughter see tiny bit whimsy screen 
 films also better enjoyed added atmosphere plant called marijuana can certainly see movie ingrains within nifty visual elements order jazz experience 
 sober expecting coherent funny musical transsexual twist didnt leave theater satisfied 
 came watched existential story confused man caught musical lifestyle wrapped metaphors dramatics questions answers 
 will hand definitely hand props lead film john cameron mitchell also man wrote directed created play movie based tunes will likely enjoyed anyone digs sex pistols david bowie whole s glamrock scene 
note btw seems though pretty much every single mainstream critic united states loved movie top bottom thought really funny boot might want take consideration 
 said main reason started dinky website first place films like sometimes uniformly applauded official critics regular joblo audience just wouldnt get fuss 
 movie perfect example continue write movie reviews 
wheres joblo coming
