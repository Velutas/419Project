im sure genius came idea comparing disturbing behavior scream 
maybe theyre horror films kinda hot young stars annoying alternative soundtrack aimed teenage crowd guess includes 
 next line scream flicks well know last summer soon flicks 
 owes less halloween kafka orwell book makes interesting feature 
 
 basically rehash stepford wives great s film never saw starring katherine ross dealing ive told bunch women programmed perfect housewives 
 something like 
 behavior starring katie holmes dawsons creek deals bunch teenagers deep angst programmed perfect teenagers 
suckups 
preppies 
 actually least sounds like work scott rosenberg witty penmen written stuff like beautiful girls things denver youre dead well con air actually sounds like may pulled right amount frights satiric wit 
alas plumets little group movies known movies potential blow 
 remember film called white mans burden dealt reversal blacks whites society nothing potentially brilliant premise 
heres another one 
 brilliant satire teenagers need go teen angst order find 
 stage film fact realize 
 gets message across effortlessly 
now just needs work film 
 doesnt 
 sloppy contrived 
 paints bleak portrait high school life 
lets lie 
 brings us bunch scary monsters bunch disgustingly icky kissups food drives hang s diner drinking milk shakes 
gives cheap twist get horny become homicidal 
isnt scary enough theyre like cant real terror town next just like next die 
 film introduces us two three different characters beginning considered outsiders theyre yet part clique new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull whos trouble home hasnt gotten brothers ethan embry quick flashes dont recognize suicide renegade girl rachel katie holmes dawsons creek whos chief personality trait prominent nose ring far interesting kid gavin nick stahl kid man without face whos interesting hes character whos given dimension 
 films best scene introduces steve every single clique nailing ones fetishes hangups best scene movie witty satirical interesting something rest film isnt 
gavin suspects theres something awry preppie kids known blue ribbons tradition conspirators even actually shows hard pure evidence steve hes treated typical raving conspiracy buff 
 another case idiot plot steve done something gavin happens may saved film dreary dull film without gavin gives life humor 
 halfinteresting character school janitor played william sadler retarded scary guy may seems 
really dont care anyway 
 probably shouldnt mention directed david nutter whos works xfiles probably tarnish reputation 
like show hes good setting weird conspiracies creating general creepy feel 
 film shot night dark eerie shadows maximum creepy effect works 
 film good coming good payoff 
 keeps much inside much characters journey mental institution third act wonder just dont get hell 
 think happens gavin proof enough theres something rotten state teen angstdom 
 film needs lot longer lot colorful lot creepier 
 best villain can come guidance counselor played bruce greenwood atom egoyan regular obviously just trying pay rent still thinks can get away even revealed need come tougher smarter villain 
 hes villainous two dense teenagers couldnt figure something going way late find information couple minutes 
 film runs minutes just needs work things become lot less sloppy 
 short running time lame boring characters pretty much obvious leaving film leaves horribly unsatisfied taste ones mouth especially mine
