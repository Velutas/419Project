jet li busted onto american action movie scene stole show s lethal weapon wicked looks nasty moves undeniable charisma 
 took another two years megaproducer joel silver set allamerican movie primed take empty actionhero seats left alleged cokehead van damme pudgy guy named steven seagal 
 film take li past rival asian action counterparts namely chow yunfat jackie chan 
lets find 
plot rival chinese black gangster organizations fall favor one another members respective families start turning dead 
thats badass jet li blasts picture find men behind brothers death exact style revenge 
critique three words enough action 
simple enough 
 enough hong kong kickass jet li action compensate horribly predictable screenplay bad actors crappy dialogue ohso many overthetop melodramatic moments 
 romance angle 
 one must ask 
 love fight scenes really dig jet li little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences jet well poor dude barely movie 
 thought supposed big break 
 bout giving slickster opportunities show us kungfu fighting chops slap scenes give chances practice actingenglish abilities 
 letdown 
even black mask entertaining glossed empty shell film 
 fact sure time spent gathering hits soundtrack film socalled screenplay 
 felt like watching soundtrack rather movie time 
 sad part bad script wouldnt matter much film actually decent actors spouting tacky lines 
 save lindo aaliyah werent shabby thought rest cast picked primarily inability deliver lines convincingly 
 deal whole nfl franchise deal run year old looking guy acting like hes overlord drug ring 
 mess 
 dont want seem like im complaining solely story completely foreseeable since go see movies action anyway story 
well guess thats disappointed film 
 couple cool fight scenes li simply enough satisfy overall craving 
also much love way incorporate wires special effects stunts couple exaggerated fight scenes simply obvious stunt 
 seamless fellas necessarily laws gravity 
 one cool thing original movie way director showed us inside cracklings human body penetrated blow simple creative touch couldnt save rest films uninteresting plot movements 
im disappointed jet li film didnt give real opportunity star good story many great action scenes 
hopefully next time will charm charismatic actor 
 now just hope sake films title isnt premonition movies ultimate fate boxoffice
