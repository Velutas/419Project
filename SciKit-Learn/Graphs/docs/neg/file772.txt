critique angelina jolie great movie 
 also three action scenes pretty cool look film 
uhhhhhm unfortunately rest movie sucked 
bad dialogue generic sidekicks bad guys lame mystery yodaesque moments mumbojumbo sprouted even crappy cgi near end 
 movie wasnt horror show early reviews warned us especially since every scene feature jolies torpedoes begging burst lucky shirts quite letdown nonetheless especially consider major opportunity filmmakers create cool hip woman hero based popular video game 
 dont know guess put blame director simon west didnt really tie whole movie together well 
 film lacked energy consistent pace well 
fun time 
 felt kinda depressed watching movie 
 father crap horrible dialogue given poor john voight recite just plain embarrassing im even gonna mention moustache hehehe 
 shite movie 
 especially hated scenes ghostlike figure friend child ramble lara crofts father time im giving one ounce crap theyre talking 
 guess thats called lack character development right 
thats movie builds enough background characters screen actually get care 
 didnt care anyone movie bored lets explain gobbledygook moments 
 even though thought jolie kicked mighty ass damn look sexy blasting guns everybody else around goddamn boring 
 butler throwaway personality sidekick supposed funny just annoyed every time said word bugger says lot trust socalled bad guys just spewed onedimension 
 spark energy amongst even though action scenes movie cool see trailer youll know ones im talking overall picture lame dialogue mystical bullcrap just buried even 
also movie thats supposed exotic locations wasnt necessarily impressed exterior shots even less interiors looked like shot room 
mind wont go far say worst movie year remember actually go see freddie prinze jr movies also definitely worst film ive seen summer movie season course still early im sure garbage heaps coming pike 
skip one altogether rent indiana jones movies instead trust 
 youll miss boobs end night rocksolid porn good
