 real tangible proof swear lot producers hollywood adamantly believe take bad script written bad writer give project equally bad director actually possible make good movie 
using logic really needs done change bad movie good movie cast bunch superfamous actors provide almost unlimited production budget 
 way can fathom th century fox hired jon amiel order direct eighty million dollar waste time counting time took get theatre 
now continue ferociously attack whats wrong film just want point one reasons fails miserably potential exciting thriller 
catherine zetajones plays virginia baker insurance investigator tracking infamous art thief named robert macdougal sean connery 
 youve ever seen hollywood blockbuster really dont spend much time frivolous plot details two team various jobs stealing various things various purposes 
 problem come weve seen billion times film doesnt break new ground bigbudgethollywoodaction genre 
 result entire production feels contrived 
im going completely honest pretty much thing keeping awake throughout runtime looking catherine zetajones 
now may compliment ms zetajones certainly isnt either writers director nearly clever think 
just profound thought can inject film macdougal lecture baker semantic difference entrapment blackmail 
 eighty million dollar budget youd think entrapment least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes breathtaking special fx 
well youd wrong 
 action present film takes place huge skyscraper relatively unspectacular 
unfortunately involved entrapment die hard narrowly beat screen years 
 reality minutes watching picture know exactly whats going happen despite rather pathetic attempts screenplay throw plot twists 
many scenes seem exist merely reason outfit zetajones extremely tightfitting clothing 
one particular scene features baker crawling around trying avoid laserbeams tries steal ancient chinese mask 
nothing wrong entered room floor knew exactly mask didnt macdougal tunnel directly mask instead side room 
ill tell great excuse photograph zetajones posterior slides underneath beams also allows second scene exact thing rehearsal 
ving rhames also makes appearance movie though great screen presence although connery zetajones interesting character film even can rescue film depths boring film abyss concept invented just describe picture 
one last complaint entrapment littered instances macdougal will just slip shadow behind building becomes obstructed moving vehicle next shot hell spontaneously disappear ninjalike fashion 
 can picture amiel patting back thinking itll leave audience wondering days 
 know jon called editing
