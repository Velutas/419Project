 missed anyone 
 obviously much changed 
 problem provided movie boasts rapidfire hilarity unexpectedly true sentiment original 
 american pie definition sequelitis 
 coarser yes pushes envelope even heart isnt 
 easy cash capitalize first films success worthier investment prolong franchise coming something original 
part reason film doesnt work think original kids quest sex comingofage stepping stone much outlet horniness 
 everything cheapened 
 behave like idiot frat boys kill drinking motivation except sex sex beer sex 
thats say cant make decent comedy premise one american pie s undoings 
missing sweetness permeated american pie thiscouldbeyou quality main players 
 characters aware popculture icons theyre even onenote 
stifler finch now caricatures jim oz kevin forced make awkward selfdiscoveries arbitrary moments none betraying writers think audiences want see 
 theres soontobenotorious scene jim superglues perfectly demonstrates yet another films ailments one also permeated say isnt director j b rodgers debut 
theres fine line comedy abject humiliation american pie wrong side 
 hard laugh characters profoundly embarrassed 
 shielded eyes watching watching horror movie 
 theres one redeeming factor american pie inimitable eugene levy jims dad pops jim hes score utters lines like mother known get frisky 
 much anymore 
 girls parents walk blurts must daughter 
 didnt get name hopefully son 
 rest movie wit wisdom levys performance 
 unworthy sequel grossfest brought back raunchy teen comedy 
 boxoffice onw keep genre going strong disappointing 
 genre needs hiatus filmmakers getting lazy
