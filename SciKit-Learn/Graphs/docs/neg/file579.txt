 stupid little movie trys clever sophisticated yet trys bit hard 
 voices woody allen gene hackman jennifer lopez sylvester stallone sharon stone computeranimated yakfest think toy story filled used merchandising one anteaters 
 main story independence worker named z allen 
 wants life just digging away underground colony 
 finds insectopia mythical place insects can run free z along colonys princess stone journey world find meaning life 
 minutes picture began wonder point film 
halfway still didnt answer 
 end credits just gave ran 
antz mindless mess poor writing even poorer voiceovers 
allen nonchalant guessed hadnt seen mighty basic instinct stone cant act even cartoon 
 film one bugs unfunny extremely dull 
hey bugs life may good time antz
