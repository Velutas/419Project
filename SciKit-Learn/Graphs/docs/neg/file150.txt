 originally saw trailer analyze months ago must admit thought looked kind lame 
 commercials started popping week two ago thought looked outright bad 
 analyze finally opened days ago odd thing happened 
 got great reviews 
critics proclaiming hilarious deadon parody mob movies 
well praise like figured must good headed theater 
 know expression says always trust gut instincts 
well turns expression valid ever gave credit 
 analyze slow unfunny badly acted 
dont get wrong think deniro one top ten greatest actors century just league 
 think problem didnt quite know approach material 
 plays character mob boss paull vitti somewhere realm comedy drama 
 played character straight along lines leslie nielson naked gun series probably lot successful 
 though plays character completely serious moments laughs others 
 doesnt work 
 creates uneven character never breaks deniro mold always know 
 movie badly paced 
 never takes 
 just crawls one scene another without forward momentum 
 think blame placed script 
 obvious writer good idea movie mob boss faces breakdown needs services psychiatrist established movie doesnt really go anywhere 
 formula film seems billy crystal says deniro deniro forces much wackiness ensues 
 formula sorts repeated several times throughout movie 
ive said ill say thing matters comedy whether funny 
 analyze funny pacing bad acting wouldnt bothered 
 busy laughing notice 
 chuckled times 
 really funny scene deadon parody godfather 
sadly though dont think anyone audience saw realized parody one laughing 
 sense humour come realize vastly different general population 
 loathed theres something mary yet loved baseketball 
now want movie think funny go see office space 
 full genuine laughs wont leave glancing watch every minutes analyze
