btw accompanied friend one required watch assignment reviews movies local paper 
now ill actually back huffing puffing 
 goes 
movie anaconda rydains bottom line wait come usa night 
even doubt worth price jolt help stay late 
 hate anaconda 
let count ways 
first movie gets way many snake facts wrong 
 ophiophile snake lover can tell anacondas never reach length feet b theyre scared people c cases snakes eating adult humans extremely rare human shoulders wide fit snakes mouth constrictor snakes dont kill cant eat d people can outrun snakes trouble especially heavy ones like anacondas e anaconda eat human need least months sitting butt digest huge meal therefore couldnt run around gobbling everybody else cast f snakes vocal cords cant make funny squealing noises 
whew 
 prepared suspend reality movie worth 
unfortunately anaconda suspenseful exciting watching paint peel 
 friend even successfully predicted live end 
anybody can tell bad guy going die eventually 
 pity character one reasons friend didnt give fall asleep 
 likable character movie 
 wouldnt enjoy somebody looks like deranged walt whitman 
anaconda cute moments arguments ice cubes character british guy instance 
however small flashes wit worth hour twentyeight minutes boring schlock 
 writers blew multitude opportunities insert funny lines 
 quite disappointed scene young guy tells young lady jungle makes horny 
 retort clever egowithering comeback 
 course 
 im trying work 
gee thats even dumber crap comebacks come 
 told go find knothole something 
 p will admit just one scene surprised outcome hint involves evil guy miss crap comebacks 
 plot im still trying find one 
 movie basically excuse get boatload people dangerous territory get snarfed ridiculous computergenerated anacondas eyes fangs vipers fasterthangravity downward acceleration harrier jet 
 harrier snake 
 mention instant digestion go snarf countless victims 
 writers tried throw sort plot twist call plot knot made sense sick guys gfriend kisses evil dude suddenly everybody hates said evil dude starts trying kill 
 clear understandable mission impossible 
 someone explain movie id grateful 
 oldguy double agents looked 
 wasnt inspired acting save evil dude 
 cant blame actors though 
 fault cruddy script work 
 concludes rydains diatribe shameless exploitation perpetuation public fear snakes 
comments flames anyone 
rydain atomic cheese fresh chernobyl dairies
