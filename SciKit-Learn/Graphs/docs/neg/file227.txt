 great twelve months either principals movie 
earlier year nora ephron wrote produced one years least likeable comedies called hanging featuring bunch annoying women ironically lisa kudrow played one film well barely time care anyone 
ick real 
sweet stuff 
 little unsuccessful project nothing compared john travolta went earlier summer film entitled battlefield earth 
 seemed person planet somehow appreciated film even cheese factor everybody mean everybody else pretty much classified movie one worst disasters time 
yipes another 
beauty 
 happens put two people room come movie costarring everversatile lisa kudrow 
uhhhm guessed 
much 
plot order escape major financial difficulties local weatherman hooks ballpicking lotto girlfriend rigs state lottery 
 people find scheme people demand part winnings problems arise 
critique simply stated didnt laugh entire picture 
 comedy offered smiles bunch nincompoops characters miscast john travolta hamming lisa kudrow can described sluttier version character phoebe tvs friends 
 film disastrous thought pretty close 
thankfully clips travolta dressed goofy outfits dancing weatherman left films trailer final cut 
 unlike worst movie year far beautiful film also managed feature many unsympathetic idiotic just plain irritating characters cast 
foremost travoltas character declined give us reason care entire movie 
 casting choice john travolta role just plain wrong 
 didnt fit part 
 just saw get shorty day thought perfect role 
 cool calculating roughneck certain hip suave je ne sais quoi 
 film looks like hes trying funny trying bad trying good 
 supposed able notice least case consider wrong choice casting 
add lisa kudrow boring us yet another one patented dumb blonde routines time dressed sexier outfits 
michael rapaport stretching one small acting muscle play guy isnt quite speed level everyone else 
 truckload empty comedic bullet shells youve got extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines never quite materialize 
 real good thing say film story actually halfinteresting never really bored 
 also liked michael moores perverted cousin character loved say loved character bill pullman played 
give dude movie 
 played lazy cop man tries everything real work 
 fakes injuries get duty tries avoid arrest situations wont fill forms now 
theres base humor 
sadly filmmakers decided bring play half hour left film 
 theres much else can say movie folks 
 whole lame included slew unlikable characters fiddling around pool unfunny lines little interest target audience 
 get somebody write movie featuring lazy cop played pullman im
