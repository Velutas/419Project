 never confused watching movie 
 meet joe black probably one visually satisfying films year cinematography music cast will dazzle us 
 time probably boring ridiculous experience hat will season 
 first marvel elegant direction graceful cinematography sensual musical score 
 youll wait something happen half hour finally understand whats going youll wonder actors anthony hopkins brad pitt claire forlani film like 
 script simply silly unresolved story artificially stretched three hour long motion picture 
 feels like eternity 
 time pompous soap opera filled empty dialogue actors deliver high pitched voice meaningful winks 
 film based alberto caesellas play death takes holiday 
 story concentrates around bill anthony hopkins lives fulfilled life successful business man sometimes wakes middle night hears voice saying yes 
soon meets young elegant gentlemen brad pitt introduces death 
 bills time 
 death plans 
 come us simple mortals find means alive 
 bill chosen deaths guide exchange gets time 
bill introduces death joe black immediately becomes center everyones attention 
bills business partners speculate joe constantly bills side lives house resides office 
 however 
bills youngest daughter susan claire forlani falls love mysterious stranger joe falls love 
 relationship bound serious consequences 
 wouldnt fair say film didnt interesting moments scene joe invited join bills family dinner 
 joe starts enjoying peanut butter later falls love experience somewhat different 
 obvious story like story difficult structure 
 one thing say wouldnt fun death take human form come earth 
 create motion picture another 
four screenwriters worked script lacks drive logic 
 overlong primitive pass serious film 
 hand demonstrates incredible performances decent direction martin brest scent woman 
hopkins looks great role matter shallow hollow will complete 
 talent charisma needed else since actually saves film complete embarrassment 
 pitt one got one difficult roles recent time 
 can play death human form 
 seems death life something can associated earthly matters 
 creatures phenomenas 
saying death takes human form suggest eternity take human form 
handling ridiculous task incredibly difficult pitt deserves credit work 
speaking calm soft voice portraying death lonely distant powerful guy unfamiliar practical earthly matters 
 looks acts like angel death rather demon redeyed executioner 
claire forlani others also fine stretching stereotypical characters limits 
unfortunately performances enough rescue film self inflicted misery 
 words expected director scent woman 
 better cast crew 
 end seems intensively working ravishingly looking soap opera
