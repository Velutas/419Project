heres rarity childrens film attempts tackle weighty subject god 
done well gem among wasteland modern childrens cinema 
unfortunately isnt 
 jumbled messages unclear audience wide awake better left asleep 
fifth grader joshua beal joseph cross middle moral crisis 
 beloved grandfather robert loggia died joshua begun quest 
 wants find god discover bad things happen 
 religious quest slightly disturbing parents dana delany denis leary best cope son explores different religious faiths 
 catholic school favorite teacher sister terry rosie odonnell tries give guidance journey must make 
meanwhile momentous year life 
 several adventures daredevil best friend dave timothy reifsnyder gets first crush begins wake world around spiritual journey 
 somewhat confusing real audience wide awake expected 
 surface appears kids film 
however deals serious issues likely boring todays instantgratification kids 
 might seem heartening see someone trying produce something thoughtful kidvid audience wide awake asks serious questions delivers cheap gimmick answer 
 bit meat story adults nostalgic bent might get kick movie 
 actors might created great cast odonnell leary delany wasted roles amount little cameos 
 nostalgic elements best friend favorite teacher first crush etc done much better movies actually seem like filler 
 films strongest scenes touching flashbacks depicting joshuas relationship grandfather 
 show depth present anywhere else movie 
maybe film better instead playing relationship flashbacks set entirely joshuas last year grandpa 
 certainly entertaining 
wide awake can best described failed experiment 
 starts noble aspirations never delivers promise 
parents take children see one prepared answer tough questions kids arent bored death first
