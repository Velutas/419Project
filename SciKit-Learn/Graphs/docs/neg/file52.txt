talk movie seemed dated even hit theaters 
spice world feature film debut prefabricated pop band spice girls 
 intended sort hard days night ends simply hard watch 
 watching spice girls im reminded old saturday morning cartoon trick smurfs snorks teenage mutant ninja turtles identically animated creatures differentiated characters merely one personality quirk different name 
 spice girls interchangable pringles talented 
theres ginger geri halliwell brainy one sporty melanie chisholm athletic one baby emma bunton childish one posh victoria adams fashionconscious one scary melanie brown one tongue pierced back far youre almost certain post sticks throat 
 film doesnt really plot 
 follows girls travel culminating first live performance albert hall 
 action however seems like hodgepodge mismatched ideas 
 various misfires include alien encounter fiendish tabloid editor scheming wreck spice girls shooting spice girls documentary movie producer george wendt trying pitch various ideas spice girls movie nearly though incredibly far fetched seem plausible mess ended meeting pregnant friend whose sole purpose seems maintain film maxim pregnant characters must give birth movie ends boating adventure bus race clubhopping wherein apparently one notices famous spice girls among crowd even 
 start sing assorted number musical performances press conferences general allaround celebrity stuff 
whew 
 reason film littered star cameos 
 elton john elvis costello bob hoskins meat loaf 
heck even roger moore shows though cant decide hes parodying james bond hes lobbying reincarnation ernst stavro blofeld 
richard e grant largest secondary part thankless role bands manager clifford 
 celebrity spotting partially amusing decent way pass time confronted rest film 
neither amusing spontaneous spice girls songs deadly boring 
 songs alright play like lifeless adaptations music videos 
 advice fans stay home watch video collection least spin cd couple times either 
option will enjoyable film 
nonfans know stay well away one
