 ladybugs typical comedy relies three supposed guarantees pathetic team beats champs cross dressing presence rodney dangerfield 
 picture doesnt play like comedy children aimed 
 told like minute sitcom instead feature film 
rodney dangerfield stars chester lee total schmuck working huge corporation 
 obviously doesnt lot self esteem thinks kiss get ahead volunteering coach companys girls soccer team 
 shock learn chester assistant julie jackee know absolutely nothing game players seem know even less 
 didnt laugh reason didnt annoy much 
chesters fiancee bess graff thinks got promotion addition coaching position course slacker son poorly school kicked sports teams 
jonathon brandis nice surprise matthew agrees dress girl named martha help chester probably girl crush plays team original story ideas 
 get just another retread underdog sports team mixed cross dressing 
unfortunately film isnt smart enough play upon drag aspect 
 fact downplays heavily totally unbelievable 
 obvious martha boy 
 wears girls wig without makeup dont even give falsies 
brandis doesnt bother mimic girls voice either 
 pointless scene chester matthew shop dress reason 
martha seen soccer field buy dress 
just think martha character going useful disappears story wanders aimlessly looking new plot pick 
 bess discovers whats really going breaks chester relationship forgotten film focuses soccer team tension chester boss 
 film couldve less bad cliche sports comedy feels need go tangents completely unnecessary bad 
theres just much sitcom feel especially socalled serious moments confusion characters 
ive seen worse movies ladybugs reason contained sort bizarre charm even turns sour doesnt seem bad 
dangerfield finally gets respect end price
