 review 
released made mammoth budget million film frank herberts cult novel dune eagerly awaited scifi fans 
director david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peaks working biggest production date mammoth undertaking filmed trying conditions location mexico 
 screenplay lynchs chosen script submitted original author herbert rejected 
dune set universe ruled powerful families overseen successive line emperors 
 key cosmic power planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet thats home giant sandworms precious spice melange 
 spice valuable commodity universe 
 extends life expands consciousness consume 
 importantly allows navigators spacing guild human now hideously mutated fold space navigate spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce trade flourish 
lynchs film necessity excises parts book retaining storys two main strands 
one longstanding rivalry two families houses atreides house harkonnen battle lucrative mining rights arrakis 
 second strand emergence young paul atreides reluctant messiah longawaited natives arrakis fremen 
 deeply religious fremen want control homeworld young paul may fulfilment prophecy man come outer worlds lead freedom 
unfortunately epic story unfolds confusing haphazard manner theatrical cut film runs minutes shorter lynch originally intended 
 thinking among universals ohsowise money men films two hours duration popular audiences time well box office 
 lynchs initial cut running closer three hours studio demanded cuts made 
 great idea 
 trim already complex film make almost incomprehensible 
 glaring consequence oneeyed stupidity hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us badly underdeveloped characters 
thus personalities vague motivations unclear case pauls father duke leto demise rather meaningless 
 end result distinct chill cant warm cast dont care much 
 hardly helps voiceover narration sparse duneesque language terminology sounds like much gobbledegook unfamiliar book 
dune also serous film 
 constant selftalk various characters makes serious selfabsorbed times may find hard wince embarrassment 
 overall impression world full people intense one allowed joke lest universe come crashing around 
humour least gentle kind humour distinct harkonnens mad sadistic kind hard find 
 may balk comparison writer lynch well done lessons george lucus star wars trilogy 
 theatrical version still way complete disaster however 
 still possesses enough lynchs stylistic quirks enough visual invention sustain interest viewers taste imaginative scifi 
special effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms awesome sight 
 production design anthony masters costume design bob ringwood striking original 
 magnificent score toto brian eno one underrated soundtracks last twenty years 
 elements place benefit freddie francis lush cinematography film least feast senses 
see widescreen format can 
 despite cuts several cast members still make strong impression notably kenneth mcmillan supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen 
sian phillips also registers strongly reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim manipulate pauls destiny shadowy ends 
 paul atreides young kyle maclachlan starts somewhat shakily character grows strength performance emerges credible leader fremen crusade 
 conclusion 
 assessment film must take account frank herberts original novel complex piece work presents tough challenge filmmaker 
david lynch took brave stab partly due forces beyond control ended officially released version fails several key respects 
dune certainly confused frustrated lot people release 
many chose stay away altogether films disastrous box office showing attests 
 extended version however rather different beast 
 lynch stated intention release special edition directors cut film home video clear indication dissatisfaction version ended theatres 
 alas failed choosing move projects 
 way partly lynchs fault appeared instead unauthorised extended version put together mca tv special projects airing cable networks usa 
stung action lynch successfully petitioned directors guild take name credits replace allen smithee standard pseudonym directors wish disown work 
 also screenwriting credit changed anonymous judas booth 
certainly looking results mcas handiwork theres least half dozen instances sheer technical sloppiness good enough reasons director object 
 gripes must considered light improvements extended cut dune offers several crucial areas 
 changes involve restoration extension cut scenes addition extra narration fill many holes original versions storyline 
pauls relationship father associates intimate moments humour warmth lacking previously 
 political skulduggery involving emperor spacing guild bene gesserits two warring houses far better explained 
pauls initiation fremen way life arrakis also fleshed considerably 
 background new prologue added featuring narration painted stills give us brief history dune universe 
 piece storytelling mca tvs version dune clearly superior 
 piece editing however times surprisingly inept 
 use painted stills new prologue works well enough occasional appearance action begins inappropriate 
theres sloppy cutting instances shots even appear order 
 use repeated footage fabricate certain scenes eg 
ships coming going soldiers coming going times clearly outofcontext 
 kind thing lynch objected rightly 
 also noted several questionable scenes shots theatrical version deleted satisfy censorship demands u s television 
 notable omission gratuitous piece nonsense lynch wasnt even herberts book 
 scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front slobbering henchmen pulling heart plug 
 surreal disturbing episode thats lynchesque adds nothing already know baron nasty piece work 
despite peculiar flaws extended version dune generally superior film 
 contains minutes restored footage approximately another minutes either altered fabricated newly created sequences 
unless idiosyncratic lynch sudden change heart alan smithee version remains closest well get movie 
 repeated viewings one suspects closer lynch prepared admit 
still one centurys great sciencefiction novels fans perhaps late herbert argue dune deserved better fate transfer screen 
 rumours circulating new six hour miniseries planned production company new amsterdam entertainment unlikely heard last dune saga
