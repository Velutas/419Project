 remake psycho appears weve got suffer remake earlier hitchcock film dial m murder 
 usual hollywood filled glitz big name stars amounts loud sounding nothing 
 film opens emily paltrow david viggo mortensen fun loft apartment 
 problem paltrow married stephen douglas happy discovers affair 
 paltrow though id definitely go mortensen 
less wrinkles 
anyhow stephen approaches david interesting proposition hell pay kill lovely wife 
mortensen agrees murder goes awry twists keep coming film progresses 
unfortunately film dosent progress fast 
 fact moves like tortoise arthritis read slow 
 plot moves nowhere fast becomes exciting short bursts 
 good thriller 
also performances apart douglas par 
paltrow showing immense talent seen sliding doors strangely stilted even unconvincing movie 
mortensen little bit better coming across younger douglas role isnt meaty enough show talent 
 leaves douglas waltz away film 
however doubt douglas finds hard play stogie smoking drinking womanizer creepy underside 
also popping film david suchet playing shifty looking detective 
 character seeing screen david suchet 
 director bought us fugitive piles flash techniques zoomins quick cuts etc lighting also interesting 
however looks cant save film depths mediocre film seemed work better single set anyway 
 screenplay o k theres hackneyed subplot douglas ruthless player wall street ending surprisingly stupid cliched 
 characters also make incredibly dumb moves especially paltrow stephen appears lose intelligence last reel 
 combination tension drama decent characters perfect murder failure round incredible disappointment 
 bright moments far 
 last thing thriller boring although film just barely manages keep interest thanks michael douglas wouldnt missing anything decided watch perfect murder 
overall rating 
review david wilcock
