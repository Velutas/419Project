 first review post newsgroup kind feel like say something negative film 
 one else seems care takes certain liberties taken historical story 
however even one thinks fiction prince egypt remains shallow 
 ill begin beginning 
 biggest difference original biblical story version moses semblance divinity bible whereas animated version gives impression reluctant hero 
maybe just knew god side id little bit confidence 
 differences well lack important female characters passing original pharoahs death like nothing thing 
 though storys focus shifted 
rather story fatherson manethnicity mangod prince egypt almost solely brotherbrother relationship rameses moses 
 originally excited story element saw movie came maudlin 
rameses moses squabble like children interests peace moses saves rameses butt even though moses one started 
 yawn didnt care anymore time moses ran murdering overseer course never happened original story moses exiled 
 enough differences 
lets talk movie 
 features moses interests making character human lacks divinity whatsoever isnt convincing anyone knows god 
 features cookiecutter iwannapleasedada rameses least given dignity voicework ralph fiennes schindlers list among things 
 film also features extremely annoying character way newimproved miriam voiced everantsy sandra bullock even though irritating thing tendency burst song apparent reason bullock replaced singing voice 
speaking contains annoying music 
 contains shallow writing 
 features extraordinary animation one good thing can say film 
 contains attempt commercialize homogenize massmarket story manifestation god 
 christian got impression blasphemy 
 writers producers took butcher knife chopchopped story
