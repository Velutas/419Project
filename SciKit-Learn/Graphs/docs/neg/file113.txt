 sequel fugitive u s marshals average thriller using association fugitive just can make extra bucks 
tommy lee jones returns role chief deputy samuel gerard grizzly cop harrison ford fugitive 
 time hes fugitive mark sheridan snipes police think killed two fbi agents course hes set police plane escort gerard riding crashes makes run gerard hot tail 
 follows hours action brought us director executive decision another film curiously involving plane 
 comparing movie fugitive prequel far superior 
 even u s marshals pretty lousy movie 
 original reasonably intelligent fugitive root audience feels strangely distanced snipes fugitive mainly know little way films overlong running time 
 fugitive gave little time develop harrison fords character u s marshals straight pulling trump card place crash almost immediately 
 honest couldnt care less snipes character got captured 
snipes performance average character gets surprisingly little screen time considering fugitive reasons ill explain later 
tommy lee jones fine ever although role hardly challenge 
 sense deja vu overwhelming 
 know role fugitive seemingly attempt develop character last film 
theres nudge nudge references first film apart nothing 
nobody even mentions harrison ford movie 
downey jnr ok fbi agent john royce whos roped chase sexy french actress irene jacob wanders movie snipes wife 
nobody looks good time performers autopilot 
 supporting cast o k comes performances u s marshals falls flat face 
 doesnt fare better plotwise either 
 film starts gerard trying capture snipes veers terrorists territory 
 said film normal average terrorist thriller seen million times using fugitive reputation make sound professional 
 film wasnt sequel fugitive probably go straight video even made average 
 films plot changing course snipes almost forgotten apart hardly features movie 
stuart baird director right theres particular scene stands 
 director usual action movie style 
even plane crash sorely lacking tension 
 special effects nice especially plane crash theres good loud soundtrack veteran composer jerry goldsmith 
 end u s marshals suffers overwhelmingly lack excitement 
sure loud dumb end u s marshals just aint fun 
bored performers lackluster plot script make good action movie
