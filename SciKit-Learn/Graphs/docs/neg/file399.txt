 robert forster found famous appearing jackie brown immediately signed little film called american perfekt 
 almost two years ago 
 waited patiently film released never 
finally forgot 
 day though perusing selection local video store stumbled upon guessed american perfekt 
 immediately rented certain amount glee rushed home view 
 now seen film understand never saw theatrical release 
 american perfekt jumbled mess 
 storyline nonexistent 
 took half movie just figure going 
 point thing really knew sure movie never going introduce plot sort 
 wants get quirkyness socalled charm alone just doesnt work 
robert forster plays psychiatrist picks amanda plummer head road together 
along way discernable destination run sorts kooky wacky characters 
 suppose freewheeling plot style supposed give film element danger excitment make sleepy 
im trying new things within realm film expense coherence 
nothing movie makes sense 
 actions characters go unexplained even theyre truly bizarre 
ill give example without giving much away 
david thewlis part drifting conman 
 one point midway movie runs forster plummer road car 
 passes see face covered blood 
 think get explanation happened 
 think wouldnt 
 american perfekt waste time 
nothing gained watching movie except maybe migraine 
 rent dont bother trying figure whats going hopes everything will resolved end 
 doesnt happen 
 explanation given misspelling perfect either
