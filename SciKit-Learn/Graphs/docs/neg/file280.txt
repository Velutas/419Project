 main problem martin lawrences pet project thin line love hate like fatal attraction variation protagonist man character irresponsible jerk case doesnt seem anything except justify womans actions 
 especially case lawrences darnell wright 
 one macho guys women lined mile long 
now dont think condone just im male 
 philosophy one heterosexual males lucky enough get hands beautiful kind girl treat like princess respect 
darnell doesnt think like 
 sleeps girls dumps 
 period film discovered newest target beautiful wealthy brandi web played nicely whitfield runs successful real estate business kill dumping childdhood friend mia king found thinking im supposed feel sorry guy 
 largely darnells fault 
 lining women youd think hed enough common sense think backfire one day mother says 
 doesnt get sense hes irresponsible also pretty dumb 
 especially get sense hes dumb brandi tells killed husband allegedly abusing 
 id put pants two seconds 
now brandi psycho bitch hard agree says darnell finale guys like treating like garbage 
one final flaw though letting brandi fall darnell begin 
brandi classy intelligent woman mba harvard initally resists darnells immature play calls woman like real life 
 sudden says yes 
 listen darnells four letter word vocabulary watch actions wonder intelligent woman fall guy like darnell period much less unhealthy obsession 
lawrence can good wants order prove needs let people write direct movies 
look movie 
four writers result long two hours couldve easily worked ninety minutes lot subplots characters appear disappear quickly came makes think writers didnt get along isnt necessary 
 bright spots though 
whitfield regina king della reese bobby brown can lazily written parts help lot 
 funny parts like example scene reese attempts fight whitfeld harrassing son damaging property theyre just enough sustain film
