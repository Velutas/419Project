 miramax started production last year buzz hype resulting anticipation began edgy film downanddirty club written directed promising firsttimer mark christopher starring hot young talent salma hayek neve campbell newcomer ryan phillippe mike myers dramatic debut 
 easily worm turn 
hype turned damage control word got thhour reshoots wrapped month ago rash studioimposed edits left virtually entire cast crew especially christopher unhappy likely possibility miramax screen finished film critics 
 last minute though miramax decide screen film hastily scheduled screening myerss last name misspelled invitation mention numerous typos press notes media audience came away noticeably less impressed included

 characters generic descriptions 
 focusing hired help christopher really missed boat 
 exception flamboyant alwayswoozy rubell myers wellmodulated turn meaty stories told studio workers people went party necessarily numerous vip guests wild eccentrics managed picked crowd clubs famously hardass doormen dance among things night away rich famous infamous taste crowd comes way ellen dows feisty dottie disco drugcrazed granny shes peripheral character best

 disco filmespecially one pinnacle movementwithout dancing 
even whit stillmans thelastdaysofdisco wasnt much concerned disco witty dialogue within group hiptoonlythemselves clubhopping preppies featured least one extended dance scene 
dancing isnt thing glazed sex may entirely christophers fault

 problem critical certain box office failure subject may run hollywood course
