cashing success white men cant jump failure solo vehicles including cowboy way drop zone wesley snipes woody harrelson reteamed hoping can strike success 
sadly dismal cliche ridden mindnumbingly boring action pic anything go havent got chance hell even coming close 
 time duo play foster brothers transit cops 
following several runins tyrannical boss robert blake obsessed money train train carries subways takingsand will let nothing stop now theres original plot device harrelsons character decides try take cash 
along way fall love womananother transit cop also hates boss 
 leads typical sibling rivalry crap usually find film standard always better brother etc etc etc doesnt help add anything film 
given better script better performers supporting roles shorter running time film almost went two hoursor just feel like film might mean might turned okay stocked worst action film cliches whose purpose appears pad film painfully long running time 
robert blake plays evil boss got pathetic bad guy film history 
 sounds like wayne newton appears think best way appear evil eyes bulging though burst sockets 
 one money trains problems 
 look script action film lacks originality suspense 
 try look heist film even worse 
 final robbery sequence almost trivialised characters definitely aint butch sundance 
 film isnt bad though 
snipes harrelson arent using dumb cliches script gives make agreeable duo stuntwork indeed excellent 
 good stuntwork save bottomofthebarrel action movie 
 youre really undemanding action freak theres chance youll like 
 youre looking something original suspenseful try somewhere elsei doubt youll find
