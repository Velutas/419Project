 going see ram shrasta big screen last night stopped video store rent movies 
luckily video guy middle recording ram shrasta 
 knew going bad print halffaces poor sound quality couldnt help 
 got 
well watching indeed bad print glad didnt dish waste three hours time sitting bad theatre watching bad movie 
 movie really sucks 
 many inconsistencies driving crazy 
 example can jackie shroff grow two feet hair just three four days 
jackie shroff looked really stupid steven seagal ponytail 
 songs bad acting bad especially deepti bhatnagars direction worst 
 comedy scenes jagdish johnny lever just made want throw

note anyone liked aatish director guess youd like movie 
 practically except sanjay dutt replaced jackie shroff 
aditya panscholi sidekick

 looked fresh wore good clothes always performance even though wasnt best saving grace movie
