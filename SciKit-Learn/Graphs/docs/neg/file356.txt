bob happy bastards quickie review 
 odd couple ii 
grumpy old men aint 
hell fellow americans aint 
walter matthau jack lemmon team even worn vehicle films past years 
odd couple ii feels terribly generic first movie made thirty one years ago feels like wonderful tale 
thats like repackaging campbells soup generic food can really 
 writer neil simon couldve made horrible mistake screen writing beyond 
throughout movie really didnt laugh 
honestly 
 mean dumb situations yeah like cropduster let old geezers without notice just really didnt seem funny 
 car rolling cliff 
 way wouldve seen humor still 
 ending gets supermushy 
 final twenty minutes lemmon meets girl thinks one loses matthau talks son wasted jonathan silverman amrriage lemmons daughter course lemmon matthau another roomie situation hands 
ooh really gave lot away im sure 
consider hospitable gester wont waste time renting muck
