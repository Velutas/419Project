 whats favorite new york moment 
 ones climbing charts 
starring john cusack kate beckinsale eugene levy molly shannon 
directed peter chelsom 
rated pg 
theres doubt romantic comedies follow distinct pattern guy sees girl guy wants girl guy goes unreasonable obstacles get girl guy gets girl 
 rare cases genders flipped 
predictability given 
rarely though romantic comedy cheap obvious pointless serendipity film uses theme excuse plot contrivances 
 lightweight doesnt begin describe 
 like antigravity 
 begins new york city bloomingdales product placement rivals cast aways fedex sheer blatancy 
jonathan trager john cusack sara thomas kate beckinsale go pair gloves 
 going perfunctory motions jonathan gets keep gloves two go ice cream followed ice skating 
jonathan falls hard sara charmed 
 writes name number piece paper truck rumbles blows hand 
 takes sign fate shouldnt together jonathan flabbergasted 
 pacify comes idea jonathan will write number dollar bill will promptly spend 
 gets home will write name number inside book love time cholera sell used bookstore 
 bill gets back book will mean meant together 
three years later 
 sara jonathan now engaged love interests 
 realize arent content 
 go looking 
 happens now absurd im almost tempted recommend film sake seeing 
 two run circles around set incredible coincidences describe contrivances werent film ohsocleverly dismissing criticism building plot around serendipity 
 course since movie fate screenwriter can anything damn well pleases 
im buying 
theres suspense know exactly whats going happen serendipity insists drilling purportedly adorable nonstory heads 
instead will meet 
 question asking will meet already 
 make matters worse every coincidence telegraphed mile away last reel bored enough actively look signs something else incredible going happen 
cusack fine beckinsale least isnt saddled another lumbering clunky screenplay shes bad luck brokedown palace pearl harbor resume just inanely pointless one 
serendipity also relieves tedium amazing eugene levy plays snarky bloomingdales salesman 
whats interest watching movie spirals around around predestined pun intended conclusion 
serendipity wants tug heartstrings tests patience
