exuniversal soldier luc battle group newermodel engineered fighters gone bad 
 review 
jeanclaude van damme oneliner early universal soldier return latest attempt remain relevant sums entire movie says done 
 film critic possibly sum van dammes recent film choices better 
 ageing action stars wisely moved film genres schwarzenegger makes many family comedies action films van damme stubbornly persists sticking used work martial arts guns 
 unwillingness perhaps inability move new genres caused van damme enter straight video world legionnaire never seeing inside multiplex 
 joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal watch film careers rapidly fizzle away 
universal soldier return truly poor 
 plot complete copy several action films decade specifically terminator judgement day similarly named soldier 
soldiers kurt russell older model supersoldier sent retirement circumstances forced battle successors good planet schwarzeneggers terminator t tried save john connor newer model killing machine t jeanclaude former universal soldier save planet rampage group guessed newer model soldiers 
considering poor box office performance soldier amazing project ever given goahead 
luc devereaux van damme sole remaining universal soldier unisol short returned normal muscular human form 
 sequel technically fourth film series following two straighttovideo duds ignored plotwise luc now human trainerconsultant sorts unisol program 
working dylan cotner xander berkeley interestingly also appeared t unisol program engineered tougher fiercer fighting force help supercomputer seth 
unfortunately upon hearing program axed government seth takes control soldiers killing everyone building except luc partner maggie daughter hillary erin reporter trapped inside 
 rest film involves luc trying keep alive beating group nearindestructible soldiers notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg 
 lots fights gun battles lame plot developments noticeable lack plausibility 
 many clich s film almost painful watch 
luc gets saddled task saving erin reporter early course single night go bickering falling kissing 
erin patheticallywritten character people getting brutally gunned around yet seem frighten finds time remind luc isnt leaving without story 
whatever 
 laughable moments include luc going strip club get internet access b group rangers given good advice luc tells weapons useless shows specific gun work better choose go battle useless weapons anyway guess wins battle 
 one single scene universal soldier return originality 
 fuelled don davis loud driving music score films many fights become almost passable mostly full ol jeanclaude moves 
director mic rodgers former stunt coordinator keeps action coming rapid pace token serious moments found 
 past work evident many moments characters thrown windows tossed buildings sent flying air thanks explosion 
 jeanclaude werent getting old slow compared younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers probably made decent action film 
 place blame squarely van dammes feet however injustice 
im sure anyone even robert deniro edward norton make writers william malone john fasanos script sound good 
one particularly painful scene erin asks luc sure aforementioned strip club will internet access 
 cringes looks mutters uh uhm 
 saw minutes 
eh scripts indeed entire films saving grace goldberg 
 chews every scene obviously enjoying role immensely 
 even gives film laughs mutters things like really dont like guy every time fails kill luc 
sadly presence enough turn universal soldier return anything better belowaverage action film truly deserves joined fellow sequels going straighttovideo
