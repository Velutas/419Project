one responses enjoy detroit rock city probably kiss fans mostly might upon first glance rating ive given film might something like oh caseys gone become jaded critic us 
just expect dumb teenage rock n roll movie like 
im wondering thing 
 feel like grand time detroit rock city 
 sort movie wish couldve lot fun didnt 
 just didnt 
surely film isnt trying win major awards expected oscarcaliber film 
 expected something 
 funny joke 
 clever prank 
 plot development 
anything 
 movie never delivers 
youve got marvel filmmakers managed come movie truly nothing 
 detroit rock city one films walk credits rolled realize just spent minutes watching movie absolutely nothing happened justify films existence satisfying realization 
 film four teenage boys huge kiss fans cleveland trying get kiss concert detroit michigan 
thats 
 big plot description review movie little plot 
 characters hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello jam sam huntington 
 garage band 
theyre pathetic like garage bands like kiss like rock n roll guess means root 
 tickets lose 
 get tickets lose 
 come crazy schemes get tickets backfire 
theres much 
frankly becomes little less exciting see try get kiss tickets halfway film total eight tickets already graced boys hands lost sheer stupidity 
oh jam real name jeremiah really really annoying ultrareligious mother reported child welfare agency 
 doesnt want see kiss hadnt figured already 
 really quite disheartening see fine soundtrack go waste pointless movie like 
weve got plenty kiss along acdc ramones thin lizzy 
 maximum overdrive awesome soundtrack big acdc fan probably one worst movies time 
 detroit rock city doesnt quite reach level ineptitude gets dangerously close 
 fact music thing keeps movie complete failure mind 
basically soundtrack earned film full halfstar means bands involved can pat back except marilyn manson whose halfhearted cover acdcs highway hell sounds like something neighbors cat coughed 
 also really sad see talents cast go waste s evident theyre trying really hard squeeze life dead turkey movie 
edward furlong done far better work natasha lyonne lin shaye hey theyve got make living hollywood 
people wanting see kiss lots will probably disappointed considering band appears five minutes plays one song 
 bad might provided energy mess 
director adam rifkin knows hasnt got much material work takes chapter michael bay book directing keeps camera spinning 
 get endless parade quickcuts splitscreens zoomouts zoomins rotating cameras effort cover sheer stupidity script 
 fun eventually becomes disorienting 
 recommend felt seasick blair witch project stay far away detroit rock city witch got nothing baby 
 havent felt urge reach hold camera still since armageddon 
 script 
 written carl j dupr sounds like madeup name ive ever heard 
 cant say blame writer distancing far script possible 
 plotless pointless rock n roll movie can fun jokes gags actually funny 
 jokes detroit rock city rarely 
 fact time really laughed priest gets stoned marijuanalaced pizza just surreal 
 rest movie just seems like just threw bunch vulgar stuff screen called comedy 
 setup just succession punchlines dont provide much way chuckles precisely setup 
 just whacked someone head pointed said see 
funny 
look woman shocked hearing loud kiss music spilled drink 
see 
funny 
look guy just got clocked telephone receiver 
twice 
see 
funny 
look kid vomiting minutes drinking inordinate amount alcohol now perform exotic dance money 
see 
funny 
 word advice mr dupr things arent funny 
 must preceded clever setup audience hasn t predicted five minutes advance 
thats ive said enough movie 
 waste time money 
 liked music dont bother buying soundtrack 
 hear s just modern bands inferior versions songs actually movie 
 want see concept executed well 
go rent roger cormans classic rock n roll high school 
 features another lateseventies rock band ramones far interesting story girl trying get tickets show 
yes go rent skip detroit rock city will probably bomb deservedly
