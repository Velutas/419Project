 love kill starts aimlessly gets progressively less coherent time passes 
 outset movie appears tony danza whos illegal distributor guns trying establish relationship unsuspecting woman 
danza sets double date sister collegue 
everything seems going well sister accidentally dies falling set stairs 
much confusion mahem ensues death covered associates danzas begin emerge one thing another 
sound confusing 
 
 think filmmakers trying take standard crime movie throw little humour levity 
 respects works 
 majority film convoluted confusing mess 
characters keep popping explanation demanding money deals occur offscreen 
 aspect movie actually works budding relationship danza dead womans sister 
 little time devoted part story never really become familiar characters dont really care happens 
well didnt least 
one thing will give movie complete departure tony danza 
heres guy many sitcom roles whos ingrained consciousness nice guy always right thing 
 plays man whos just looking means needs kill order save skin 
 impressed performance within minutes start film forgotten goodguy persona 
michael madsen also good associate danzas spends half movie buddying half trying kill 
like said exactly linear storyline 
 love kill praised trying something different well worn crime genre just bad story doesnt really add much 
 stars deserved better audience
