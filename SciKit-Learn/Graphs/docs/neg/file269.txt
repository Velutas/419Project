 know summer less memorable 
 total decent films surprise big budget failures keep appearing 
 said can pretty much predict opinion th warrior will 
 film based michael crichton eaters dead ahmed ibn fahdlan banished country looking wife king 
 tarveling many months comes across gang norsemen forced pick men protect town mythical monsters travel fog 
 start picking men left without thus ahmed choosen 
 far sounds interesting right 
 takes place minutes 
 basically run around killing 
 alone shows much script needed film story introduced rest film start developing 
obviously thats case 
even going film expecting action packed adventure will disappointed 
since action takes place fog constantly hard see scene clearly due circumstances poor camera work 
cant camera men sit still 
id like actually watch film focus failed deliver well 
 film moves point can care less anything popcorn youre eating 
 corny dialogue characters laugh odd reason script goes nowhere dull action sequences predictable ending worst weak characters theres basically nothing like except maybe set designs 
thats thing honestly caught interest 
 heard john mctiernan director wanted name kept project made wonder 
well now know 
crichtons greed forced mctiernan edit finished product led big arguement 
whats argue anyway 
 film couldnt saved matter much spent casted 
seeing films like haunting big daddy making money wouldnt surprised see th warrior become hit 
please favor save money costs else will lost fog like film
