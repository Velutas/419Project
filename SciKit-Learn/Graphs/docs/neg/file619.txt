gregg arakis doom generation possibly worst film ever made 
 see latest teen bisexual angst opus 
first reviews fairly positive 
also cast consisting cameos dozens washed ex tv stars including christopher knight eve plumb shannen doherty david leisure promising 
last wanted give arraki one chance 
 mean guy cant untalented can 
 answer question three letters long 
nowhere follows character dark wild odd journey los angeles 
since arraki doesnt know make anything coherent hard describe plot 
lets just say dark spends bulk movie whining girlfriend wont make commitment jealous sleeps around guys girls 
 remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez teen chance encounter famous tv star 
 turns nice guy doesnt care fame wishes walk street without mobbed fans 
 story shocking twist tragic end see coming 
 first time ever felt compassion character created arraki can attributed appealing performance lassez 
 thought maybe arraki improving craft 
 works better camera time around especially early scenes 
halfway film didnt necessarily find enjoying film seemed like considerable improvement doom generation 
 movie went arraki loses sensibility introduces us exploding heads twisted sex games alien abductions 
 sad almost actually decent material ruined usual face im renegade maverick filmmaker look can attitude 
 performances generally better doom generation isnt saying much 
 least dont suffer jonathan hideous man america schaech 
 however treated another round james im wooden keanu duval 
sarah lassez gives best performance film kathleen robertson formerly now arrakis wife rachel true talented actresses caught mess 
 tv star cameos john ritter interesting deranged right wing tv evangelist 
 prefer nowhere doom generation way prefer assassinated receive constant physical torture 
maybe greg arraki doesnt want like characters 
maybe wants laugh make fun us try care 
maybe just wanted piss 
 successful
