nearly every film tim burton directed homage horror genre frankenweenie beetlejuice batman edward scissorhands ed wood mars attacks 
 yet none horror films 
 sleepy hollow first attempt actually scare people 
 greeted prospect high anticipation burtons whole career seemed leading 
 left disappointed 
andrew kevin walkers screenplay takes character names classic short story legend sleepy hollow 
 movie ichabod crane johnny depp new york city police constable trying introduce scientific methods investigation superiors 
ichabod dispatched small town sleepy hollow investigate series murders 
several towns leading citizens decapitated headless horseman 
although rejects ghost story town elders tell ichabod finds facts case confound scientific reasoning 
 also discovers killings random victims tied together secret 
along way ichabod gets help bewitching literally young woman christina ricci son one murder victims marc pickering 
 reaction hohum 
 plot accumulation cliches without even slightest touch originality make interesting 
 forgivable hollywood constantly tries sell us used products new packages 
however burtons attempts inducing fright come goofy 
 might background previous movies goofy goal 
along lines doesnt help creature designer producer kevin yagher done best work tongueincheek tales crypt tv series 
 witchs eyes tongue shoot like roger rabbits tree spurts blood like monty python sketch headless horseman 
 
 
well hes guy without head 
 
 
 horse boo 
 performances also awful 
although hes impressed work films depp doesnt seem know ichabod dialogue hampered stilted diction thats supposed pass th century accent 
ricci seems put effort seeming enigmatic guarantees wont sympathize character 
 actor revealed end villain comes ridiculously cartoonish 
 pleasure generated cast comes surprise cameos christopher lee martin landau christopher walken 
 wonder movie originally conceived part francis ford coppolas projected series gothic adaptations series produced bram stokers dracula mary shelleys frankenstein 
coppola executive producer sleepy hollow script reflects interest early forms moving pictures particularly toy ichabod carries blends two pictures create optical illusion 
 theres bird one side card cage 
 card flipped rapidly bird appears caged 
bottom line hollow isnt thing thats sleepy
