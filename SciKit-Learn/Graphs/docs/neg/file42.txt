 problem films refuse constricted linearity time pulp fiction twisted time every way masterpiece take exception movies decide play around reason confuse viewer 
 limey exactly 
 plot permeated flashbacks flashforwards can described random timetravel without evident purpose 
 method movies madness 
 uses fancy way tell story better told conventionally comprehendably 
 plot isnt particularly interesting first place traditional mildly hackneyed involving 
 sort brooding film protagonist doesnt speak much action sequences done annoyingly perfunctory attitude 
 felt like director wasnt interested proceedings almost like made film paycheck 
ditto editing seems deliberately sloppy unpleasant 
sixties icon terrence stamp manages least menacing aging criminal 
hes much way stature surprisingly imposing physical presence works advantage 
peter fonda unbelievably underrated actor hes shy quiet always effective 
hes adept conveying emotions speech rather expression feelings dont always show face can always tell 
 basically conventional thriller told pretentiously bizarre fashion 
 soderbergh couldnt just parrot tell story dont know certainly doesnt work 
 result wild cornucopia images amount precisely nil even action scenes dont work 
 may signified death traditional act one act two act three storyline obviously movies yet transcended 
shall go back basics
