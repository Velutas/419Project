now please dont think im spoiling vital plot details informative trailer already spilled beans 
 havent seen preview dont read 
 seriously inane screenplay douglas weisberg douglas s cook elementary average viewer will two three steps ahead characters 
 vital scenes movie anticipating every twist surprise eventually popped screen 
 imagine writers presume core audience double jeopardy naive group individuals 
 unfortunately will distracted moronic plot appreciate positive aspects production 
one tommy lee jones plays travis lehman parole officer given tedious task watching libby serves sentence prison 
jones always wonderful authority figure hes certainly familiar sort role played well fugitive us marshals 
judd likable heroin gusto also chance flex acting abilities 
 emotionally unconvincing actress tremendously fun juvenile role perking movie like injection antidepressant 
 actors relationship together present onetwo punch prevents double jeopardy derailing entirely 
 now back plot 
 behind bars libby learns interesting little bit information person cant convicted crime twice 
 law called double jeopardy motive hunting husband 
 may still alive 
yes heard right 
 movie degenerates crosscountry chase everything expect happen 
 
 final scenes redeemed film poorly handled director bruce beresford whose previous work centers highly around drama driving miss daisy paradise road 
ironically elements like driving force libby reunite son dont quite work 
 least double jeopardy paced well enough satisfy diehard fans two stars 
unfortunately jones lacks edge sam gerard fugitive real depth character skin deep 
 ashley judd welcome considering material memorable comic moments 
judd particular hilarious scene wards oncoming male explaining check parole officer 
hmmm 
perhaps made good comedy 
 disappointing makings competent action film 
 nicely shot choreographed downtown vancouver will entertain arent turned woeful storyline 
 tis shame double jeopardy adult thriller wouldnt fool children
