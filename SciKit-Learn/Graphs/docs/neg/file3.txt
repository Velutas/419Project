quick cuts cool music claire danes nice hair cute outfits car chases stuff blowing like 
sounds like cool movie 
 first fifteen minutes quickly becomes apparent 
 mod squad certainly slick looking production complete nice hair costumes simply isnt enough 
 film best described cross hourlong cop show music video stretched span hour half 
 comes every single clich 
 doesnt really matter film based television show plot elements recycled everything weve already seen 
 characters acting nothing spectacular sometimes even bordering wooden 
claire danes omar epps deliver lines bored really transfers onto audience 
 one escape relatively unscathed giovanni ribisi plays resident crazy man ultimately thing worth watching 
unfortunately even hes enough save convoluted mess characters dont much apart occupying screen time 
 young cast cool clothes nice hair hip soundtrack appears film geared towards teenage mindset 
despite american r rating content justify film way juvenile older mindset 
information characters literally spoonfed audience hard show us instead telling us dialogue poorly written plot extremely predictable 
 way film progresses likely wont even care heroes jeopardy youll know arent 
basing show s television show nobody remembers questionable wisdom especially one considers target audience fact number memorable films based television shows can counted one hand even one thats missing finger two 
 number times checked watch six clear indication film one 
 clear film nothing attempt cash teenage spending dollar judging rash really awful teenflicks weve seeing late 
avoid film costs
