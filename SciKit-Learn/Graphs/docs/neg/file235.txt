five years directorial debut based stephen kings writings called shawshank redemption writerdirector frank darabont returns big screen another prison film based famous scribblings stephen king 
unlike latter film one big long laborious bore 
plot sevenfoot death row inmate discovered secret healing powers 
critique film slow drawnout boring uninteresting unexciting predictable topped couple onedimensional evil characters 
 positive attribute lies actors credible jobs message hope belief miracles 
 real miracle night fact fall asleep straightforward unimpressive film guy special powers never truly understand care 
 course much like death row cell blocks one filled decent inmates happen misunderstood except one cookiecutter crazy guy evil personified 
 lets forget guards death row also happen angels heaven except one cookiecutter crazy guard also evil personified reason six guards appears three inmates 
 supposed identify anyone film 
 even importantly supposed give rats ass anyone film 
well sure missed boat thing ended caring entire picture obscene amount fat tom hanks able burrow loose chin 
furthermore absolutely reason world director frank darabont needed take three hours ten minutes anyones life present story 
 fact story empty within 
 truly get anything film fact guy death row special powers heal left wondering still executed 
wow 
 interesting 
 plots utter predictability also fault one guess get healed gentle monster film told one certain lady tumor early movie 
whip thinking caps kids 
hmmm wonder will happen two cookiecutter evil guys nothing system hate negativity 
hmmmm now think hard boys girls 
 crock 
 guessing film supposed threehour exercise spirituality unfortunately neither spiritual least bit engaging 
 fact one big bore 
 didnt see point movie didnt see point story certainly didnt see point tom hanks big doublechin 
 bad movie starring great actors solid work especially michael clarke duncan man hour john coffey 
give man award something
