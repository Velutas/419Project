 worst movie ive seen since bad walked jingle way 
 crap toast made crap baked oven fueled crap 
 crap 
nothing works film expected joel schumacher made one watchable film entire career cousins 
heres man admits hes medicore director rather charmingly selfeffacing statement 
 truth told much worse mediocre 
 scorn heaped schumacher though akiva goldsman allowed write ever 
 plot anywhere dialogue unrelentingly shallow preposterous boring 
 set mr freeze tragic figure trying cure cryogenically frozen wife completely sabotage character giving lamest oneliners 
 turns stock maniacal villain thoroughly enjoys villainy instead brooding scientist spent much life bringing wife brink death 
 thats par course nothing film makes sense including half arnold schwarzeneggers lines 
 mr freeze arnold given way much dialogue spit 
 problem jingle way seems austrian accent getting thicker unintelligible days pass 
personally think pull directors doesnt retake scenes make understandable 
compare dialogue terminator series load nonsense streams forth batman robin 
apparently james cameron knows get competent performance arnold 
uma thurman bad nothing resembling good either 
 poison ivy vamps around terribly chewing scenery left right 
 pamela isley scenes marred subsnl standard acting shes reading cue cards laugh given moment 
given script wonder didnt happen frequently 
 redeeming feature film george clooney batman chris odonnell robin alicia silverstone batgirl 
michael gough eerily sickly looking alfred conceit illness prompted cadaverous appearance 
 fact something unsettling appearance seems accomplished without makeup tricks looking scenes documentary dying man 
unfortunately every scene alfreds sickness bungled incompetence absolutely emotional resonance just go motions losing whatever impact scenes supposed impart 
 movie rife poorly choreographed fights scenes never give sense big battle know theres bunch people instead melee schumacher decided focus foot fist 
theres never moment awe wonder mayhem 
 interesting part battles scenes freezing effects impressive probably expensive 
even fights full camp stupidity become unwatchable 
 hockey team hell 
 even tv series got stupid least grand scale stupidity batman robin showcases 
frustrating various supporting characters walk nothing say 
blink youll miss elle macpherson julie madison vivica fox even film vamp freezes lair two lines pat hingle ineffectual commissioner gordan batman series ever 
 almost seems like effort save costs vendela kirsebom lines mrs fries isnt even filmed well enough look good trust shes quite attractive outside dreck 
 film werent bad enough limp along bad direction bad dialogue bad performances bad fight scenes inconsistencies illogic galore 
 know nitpicky ask hundreds feet cable stored batarangs characters arms arent ripped sockets accomplish onearmed batarang save falling hundreds feet holding another person less moisture comes freezes weapon creates tons ice 
thats traditional comic book stuff 
 batman spring trap freeze public charity event endanger lives hundreds bystanders 
 big switch clearly marked heat mr freezes lair 
 countless bumbling police officers even try take mr freeze hand hand 
 alfred encourage silverstone become batgirl even go far suit made 
 batman robin take minutes bicker leaving batcave response emergency 
 since established early ivy using pheromones dont wear masks filter 
 go 
 batman robin braindead pointless garish loud film still reign worst film year time rolls along 
note warner bros youre going make another batman film please replace schumacher nearly anyone 
 actually get worse 
 schumacher understand comic book doesnt automatically equal unbearable idiocy 
 true equation seems schumacher batman unbearable idiocy
