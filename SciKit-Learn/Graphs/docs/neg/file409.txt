 arrived paris june surprised find france plastered posters twin peaks fire walk since movie wasnt scheduled open u s late august 
happily filmthe prequel david lynchs cult television serieswas playing fancy thx theater 
unfortunately theater far impressive movie absolutely stinks much like french lavatory 
worse actually 
fire walk directed lynch will completely incomprehensible anyone seen tv series read laura palmers secret diary 
 twin peaks junkies like movie marginally improved 
 plot jumbled illogical mention excruciatingly sluggish 
 first minutes almost nothing main story line feature chris isaak kiefer sutherland fbi agents investigating murder portland oregon 
 movie stops philadelphia nonsensical cameo david bowie brief appearance kyle maclachlan dale cooper 
lynch drops plot strand altogether abruptly shifts setting twin peaks washingtonone year later 
ah twin peaks familiar territory think angelo badalamentis distinctive musical score chimes 
wrong 
 movie proves really cant go home least lynch cant 
 quarter characters tv series appear movie leland palmer bobby briggs james shelly leo log lady othersmostly meaningless cameos 
 rest twin peaks cast nowhere seen consequently lynch fails recreate spirit flavor tvs enigmatic town 
cast members michael ontkean sherilyn fenn piper laurie richard beymer sorely missed mention lara flynn boyle replaced lackluster moira kelly crucial role donna 
 movie concentrates solely laura palmer sheryl lee suffers drug abuse prostitution incest miserable last seven days earth 
 night lauras death truly terrifying films remotely effective sequence 
 finally get see exactly happened laura jumped james motorcycle ran woods lonely traffic light middle nowhere 
 murder unfolds just agent cooper reconstructed tv series gratifying faithful twin peaks viewers 
 awfully small reward sitting painfully awful movie
