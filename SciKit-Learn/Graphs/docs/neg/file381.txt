 want involved show business one day 
 refuse sequels movie may make believe get worse 
 movie proves 
 little worried last batman film thought joel schumaccer taking tim burton screw 
 also assumed val kilmer screw bruce wayne 
 didnt 
kilmer good job cast left carry movie even jim carrey riddler cant stand jim carrey schumaccer messed direction glitzy gotham awkward camera angles 
 film different 
 cast still impressive schumaccer mess direction hes one directors whos good actors terrible camera angles writer akiva goldsmith doesnt really give impressive cast anything 
 cast impressive clooney surprisingly good waynebatman odonnell crafty robin usual couldve casted somebody better batgirl friend likes neve campbell silverstone bad thurman good poison ivy 
 major problem schwarzenegger terrible freeze 
 accent heavy cant understand says trouble action stars like act know figure flex muscles say limited amount stuff kill bunch guys figure nobodyll notice 
thats trouble notice 
schwarzenegger deserve billing clooney much money got hollywood thinks 
patrick stewart person id heard considered play freeze wouldve much better 
 sean connery arnold im actor play one real life schwarzenegger 
 realize must star play major role batman film wouldve nice theyd casted star talent role 
akiva goldsmiths screenplay avoids stuff happens normal batman film 
 regular batman film theyd concentrate relationship girlfriend little elle macphersons julie madison limited never get real sense 
 talk fifth batman movie 
 interest see low hope better 
 dont want waste time rent batman movies blockbuster
