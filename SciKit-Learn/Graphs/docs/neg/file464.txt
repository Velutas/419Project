synopsis melissa mentallydisturbed woman likes smoke seduces doug minorleague baseball player likes study anatomy work motorcycles make girlfriend public library 
 doug decides stop seeing melissa maliciously takes revenge around including girlfriend mother cat 
comments malicious suppose acceptable moview cheap bmovie thriller rips dozens dozens spurnedpsycholoverwhowantsrevenge films like fatal attraction hand rocks cradle etc etc come 
malicious however really doesnt provide many particularly suspenseful moments 
 plot starts energetically enough main characters introduced affair doug melissa begins ends pretty early film 
 starts drag unfortunately 
melissa will obviously try take revenge doug always seems happen movies like unimaginative ways done better thrillers 
 drugs someone 
 kills family pet leaves girlfriends apartment 
 course stalks see number shots supposed suspenseful shes spying doug girlfriend 
 wont reveal ludicrous ending turkey warn painfully obvious real yawner 
john vernon remarkably good job playing notsobright baseball jock initially gets swept away melissa one scripts faults try pass character like premed student 
 said though molly ringwald 
 times can effectively pull obsessed lover routine especially silent imgoingtostareyoudown scenes 
 times however just seems somehow goofy place 
 one particular scene guess supposed suspenseful screeches fk bd throws phone 
 delivers line ridiculously one cant help laugh 
malicious certainly isnt worst thriller kind video racks number really fat turkies genre isnt good original either 
feel free treat film maliciously watch something else
