new line cinema spent millions dollars creating expressionistic film noir visuals paying actors doesnt way get back 
 paid matinee screening dont way get money back either 
youll hear lot critics look feel movie 
 will admit cinematographers costume designers set artists cgi graphics geeks worked hard create stunning nightmarish future world always late night complete rotary phones automats fedoras 
ive got news fellows dont care hard worked visually stunning movie looks wasted time mine working movie without plot without clear sense direction wanted go without soul reason care 
 movie starts ohsopromising 
john murdoch rufus sewell lying bathtub sort seedy hotel real life boarded long ago 
 dead mutilated prostitute room surprise lost memory 
 phone rings sinistersounding man claiming doctor telling flee life 
 well good right 
wrong 
apparently someone decided audience just bit dim figure intricacies plot 
 getting popular assumption hollywood 
 actual beginning movie sewell running life rather voiceover narration aforementioned doctor keifer sutherland explaining exactly going responsible 
 though sam piano player told us rick ilsa getting paris first three minutes casablanca 
 wait thats fair casablanca 
 like watching new plotline first show want know really feel offscreen narrator explain gilligan wont getting island episode 
 coherence plot goes faster insert monica lewinsky joke 
 characters just wander around city aimlessly bump apparent reason thats moves plot 
 left string unanswered questions dont make sense 
 given aliens unlimited omnipotent powers yet forget use critical moments get killed 
 given hero can tune powers yet uses convenient plot 
 given whole long list loose ends go nowhere 
usually critics will say actor playing underwritten part isnt given much 
 movie one given anything 
sewell given impossible role man doesnt remember anything plays like 
um 
 man doesnt remember anything 
 aliens tall pastyfaced bald wear long black cloaks fedoras remind us theyre evil theres child alien well straight anne rice novel 
sutherland saddled limp twitchy eye breathy accent remind us hes league aliens 
 credit dark city boasts two impressive bits casting 
william hurt perfectly cast worldweary inspector charged catching man murdering prostitutes city 
jennifer connelly playing sewells love interest given two alltoobrief moments screen lounge singer turns sexiest performace side jessica rabbit 
 instead dogged policeman femme fatale given central treatment script way selfrespecting noir movie theyre almost tangiential plot 
 problem dark city bad science fiction movie pretending film noir 
 essence film noir isnt proyas seems beleive breathy dialogue snapbrim fedoras tall bald evil villains make peter lorre curl corner 
dark city one bit intrigue moral ambiguity suspense anything else keeps us coming back noir classics 
dark city like intricately carved door kate winslet floats titanic 
 exceptionlly wellmade intricately designed piece flotsam sailing around around middle ocean going nowhere
