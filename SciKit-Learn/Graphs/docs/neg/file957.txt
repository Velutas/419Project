godzilla ultimate culmination cares plot summer movie 
 loose remake classic japanese monster movie godzilla king monsters pretty thin story department roland emmerich dean devlins bigbudget lizardstompsmanhattan disaster flick written brain dead mind 
 script isnt just dumbed lobotomized 
godzilla lives dies special effects alone 
presumably primary target group film teenage boys demographic likely shell repeatedly see images monsterinstigated carnage 
thats say females age groups immune special effects seduction theyre just readily susceptible 
 third straight movie row emmerich devlin demonstrated mastery computergenerated visuals far important making money ability write direct actors 
stargate financial success 
independence day runaway hit 
 godzilla already drowning hype merchandising tieins even opens virtually guaranteed least million 
nice numbers film penned nottooprecocious grade school kid 
godzilla isnt completely without merit although close 
theres certain visceral thrill inherent watching giant lizard rip way manhattan wears quickly 
frankly special effects competent theyre stunning 
theres nothing new jurassic park meets aliens little independence day thrown bad measure 
maybe will require george lucas new star wars movie take computergenerated visuals next level 
godzilla never really pushes envelope preferring remain within comfort zone 
 imagination monster movies like king kong replaced crass formulaic approach disallows creativity 
 disturbing know godzilla chosen close st cannes film festival 
worst godzilla isnt even exciting 
 possible exception mildly enjoyable car chase near end isnt sequence film raises pulse 
even scenes dozens aircraft attacking monster devoid tension suspense yawnprovoking 
independence day may dumb full adrenaline moments capable getting audience involved action 
 aspect production many others godzilla lacking 
actually part problem never sure supposed rooting green monster attitude paperthin humans trying stop 
 plot can summed rather simply 
 sinking ships leaving footprints tropical islands godzilla shows big apple 
 usual tourist things stops madison square garden visits chrysler building goes walk central park takes subway 
 process knocks buildings steps countless cabs never trouble traffic jams 
 hand stop elite u s army unit led slightly lessarrogantthanusual military man kevin dunn biologist named nick tatopoulos theory godzilla 
 opinion big guy actually lizard grown enormous proportions result radiation given french atomic bomb tests south pacific 
 nicks words godzilla mutated aberration incipient creature first kind 
 luck nicks old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo reporter based new york tv station 
along cameraman friend animal hank azaria decides follow nick around trails godzilla 
 just military rejected nicks theory godzilla new york member french secret service jean reno recruits special assignment 
instead stomping around tokyo time godzilla chosen new york city 
unfortunately manhattan destroyed many times recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon becoming boring 
 whole tradition monsters roaming around city started king kong big ape feet tall 
 climb empire state building 
 ten times height godzilla likely knock 
godzilla contains lame attempts humor 
theres ongoing feud animal wife plays like sitcom material unfunny repetitive gag one can pronounce nicks last name properly rather tame attack film critics roger ebert gene siskel 
 popular personalities alter egos film ebert mayor new york played michael lerner gene lorry goldman campaign manager 
eberts reelection slogan surprisingly thumbs new york 
 siskelebert stuff amusing first time used grows tiresome 
 although characters dont serve real purpose keep popping 
godzilla saddled unimpressive cast 
 largely emmerich doesnt want risk human performance upstaging lizard 
thats say matthew broderick jean reno arent capable good performances done share solid acting past arent alist names 
 considering quality writing even pacino deniro hard pressed shine 
maria pitillo dear god plays love interest hank azaria great expectations hand present supposed comic relief 
ultimately doesnt really matter critic matter say movie 
tristar assumed godzilla like selfproclaimed summer event motion pictures pretty much criticproof 
 may also wordofmouthproof 
 want see movie will see matter write friends say 
 go record assert godzilla one idiotic blockbuster movies time like spitting wind 
emmerich devlin master illusionists waving wands mesmerizing audiences smoke mirrors 
 probably much hope day moviegoers will wake realize theyve
