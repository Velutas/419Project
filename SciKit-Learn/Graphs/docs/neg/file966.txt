 book remained shadows 
book shadows blair witch 
 film review michael redman copyright michael redman 
certain things lives inevitable 
death sorrow love heartbreak pain joy 
 expect events 
 know theyre going happen even look forward 
 part human condition 
 also become accustomed inevitable occurrences society 
 near fall election several hitting us face 
politicians exaggerate importance 
 side always right always wrong 
 end voters usually forced choose lesser two whocares 
 hollywood one indisputable inevitable film makes big money will sequel 
even original story doesnt merit one 
even first film complete 
even success fluke 
 blair witch project made budget exploded screen raking huge profits 
 concept brilliant 
 filmmakers created remarkable buzz story might real 
 film even convincing 
 movie must authentic 
 else amateurish footage big screen 
 first film caught lightning bottle 
 sequel proves cant pour old lightning new bottle 
 give effort credit 
 easy made movie new group kids 
 easy course wouldnt worked 
instead book shadows acknowledges first film movie concentrates hysteria following release 
 great scheme possibly entertaining way sequel 
unfortunately doesnt work either 
five kids spend night woods scene first film 
weird stuff happens retreat old factory one lives 
even weirder stuff happens 
 people die theres blood knives none characters lick common sense 
 supposedly serious research group sets circle surveillance cameras ruins old house woods vows stay alert night awaiting visitation 
 proceed get totally trashed drugs alcohol party loud obnoxious heavy metal music 
 bad plan 
 cast shows early promise 
 couple research blair witch book 
 tour guide former mental patient turned ebay aficionado 
 goth amazon princess adds bit comedic relief 
 obligatory hot babe spiritual cinematic descendent cute hippie chick cute rock roll chick cute disco chick cute wiccan chick 
 first films unaccomplished actors came across real people real situation hours hours video shot days woods 
 time unaccomplished actors just come across unaccomplished actors 
theres one character care start shouting reason 
although passes plot starts solid idea ruined poor execution 
 followup one successful horror films ever nothing bad slasher movie 
theyre trapped old big weird house 
 stupidly separate various rooms 
 strange noises see scary apparitions people disappear 
ever see movie 
seasoned documentary director joe berlinger know better 
 film features mostly cheap tricks unnecessary gore 
 storyline filled surprises oddly predicable 
 blair witch project rare triumph style substance 
 book shadows triumph tedium promise
