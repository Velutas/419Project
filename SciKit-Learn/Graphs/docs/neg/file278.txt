 bad films recent years mr 
magoo far worst ever made spectacularly bad blue face horrible baby genuises now woke early day died 
 may however worst movie made certainly ranks one bad movie 
 films acting thats want call well mediocre 
loaded sensational cast think cast least save film bit boy wrong 
 escaping mental institution thief played billy zane goes real world finds pretty harsh gritty 
 turns burglary survive robs loan back kills loan officer runs thousands 
 countrywide man hunt catch bring 
 ends cemetery puts money coffin keep later comes back realizes someone took put somewhere 
now determined kill visitors funeral earlier day gets money back ultimately leading finale less satisfying 
 film based longlost script ed wood one question dialogue music movement exactly point 
 film moves along rather slow pace one advantage soundtrack catchy vibrant except first song can offensive 
 opens fun innovative opening credits sequence quickly goes downhill 
 low points thief steals womans purse faints sandra bernhard dancer tippi hendren deaf woman thief kills music psycho 
come people get new ideas already

well certain extent cares time middle film arrives bored mind ready something fun exciting happen 
 woke early day died perfectly bad film 
 shows us low filmmakers get sometimes just desperate make movie 
even huge cast talent film waste time certainly waste
