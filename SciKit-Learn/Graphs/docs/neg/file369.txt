one unpleasant experiences can occur movie theater cast fine actors end film wastes talents

 name jerry 
 happy flashes across screen 
 unsettling psychologist 
 happens jerry gets mad asks 
barnes pragmatic needs last name cant put report made contact alien named jerry 
 situation turns bad 
deadly beasts appear nowhere 
 gang jellyfish kills one navy personnel 
lethal sea snakes attack goodman 
 giant squid batters habitat just adams reading leagues sea 
 suspicious scientists turn 
 makings firstrate thinking mans science fiction film 
however even finest ingredients dont go far hands chief doesnt seem care product 
director barry levinson churned mishmosh doesnt engage audience beyond skillful suspense scenes 
 first film zooms situation players introduced without characterization justification 
 much like speedreading novel realizing missed nuances 
 doesnt get better action scenes begin 
 actors adequate job limited roles people still flat 
oddly hardly reactions deaths occur around 
 adams experiences interior sphere one bothers ask happened 
 history together intriguing plot device barely exploited 
even goodman halperins illconceived affair student just mentioned passing 
 psychotic tendencies talked never convincing 
theres truism items shown early movie must used ending far obvious 
 emergency minisub explained know whats going happen 
 movie affectations nothing distracting 
chapter headings divide movie function 
 shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos 
much goes confusing difficult follow 
although disorientation eventually understandable great deal isnt 
even science fiction film must internally consistent 
theres much doesnt make sense 
 manifestations real 
 jellyfish kill queen latifa throwaway role squid nearly destroys outpost bites fatal snakes effect 
 scene sub suggests illusion earlier episodes indicate 
 everything explained death major questions film never answers 
 ship came clarified ended ocean floor merely alluded 
even enigmatic sphere still mysterious credits roll 
 climax followed minutes epilogue little weaken already labored tale 
 prerelease audience testing actors called back reshoot ending 
 difficult imagine original worse 
following recent tradition lengthy films weighs two long hours 
 weak scenes cut wouldnt much left 
 movie supposedly held effects work theres nothing special screen 
 never even see monstrous squid menacing storm 
stealing alien abyss disastrous event horizon film learned nothing 
remarkably levinson hoffmans currently showing film wag dog smart entertaining piece work 
 one titled sans one word
