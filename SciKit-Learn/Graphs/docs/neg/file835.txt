 meg ryan irresistible comedy celebrates sisterhood 
screams television ads hanging disastrously written reallife sisters delia nora ephron sloppily directed diane keaton 
make laugh 
 hanging misadvertised since film wholeheartedly focuses middle sister meg ryan gives two costars lisa kudrow diane keaton little extended cameos dont actually come together final ten fifteen minutes 
 supposed believe strong bond smile last scene rekindle rocky relationship despite apart majority running time 
excuse almost bust gut truly delusional notion 
eve marks meg ryan middle mozzell sister still living california town grew husband adam arkin preteen son jesse james 
 elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau brightest performance years just recently put hospital final stages assume alzheimers even though film never enlightens us exactly wrong 
 eves relationship mother cloris leachman nearly nonexistent since ran lou children years ago fair share ups downs lou used alcoholic 
 older sister georgia diane keaton editor selftitled magazine georgia maddy lisa kudrow youngest soap opera actress 
interestingly professions given ever see working jobs matter learn much anything 
maddy georgia eve see much anymore adult lives gradually causing drift apart manage consistently talk phone one another 
 talk 
 talk 
 talk 
 fact telephone major star film even ryan appears virtually every scene interminable minute catastrophe feels like three hours long 
 able get opening halfhour phones ring much feel like jumping screen taking sledgehammer will surely survive rest 
 question want subject resolutely irritating selfinvolved patontheback 
 comedydrama starpower meg ryan lisa kudrow diane keaton bad many different ways 
issues past involving possible jealousy one others fleetingly brought film isnt mature enough deal thing thoughtful manner since learn next nothing childhood lost cause comes nothing afterthought 
also expected viewer quickly catch tricky dynamic three sisters one another dynamic metamorphosizes 
 reunite finale whole consanguinity reduced repulsively annoying threeminute scene argue like little children 
 can see impending death coming mile away conveniently occurs next scene three can quickly come terms 
 think thing left playful foodfight like clockwork also occurs end credits 
meg ryan versatile actress look s hurlyburly s man loves woman despite various detractors stubbornly believe can romantic comedies 
 hanging thing needs completely sever filmmaking ties nora ephron writerdirectorhack shouldnt allowed work hollywood bigbudget highprofile debacle 
even knew making exactly par quality department nonetheless good two scenes work flashbacks christmas heartbreaking runin mother halloween lou crashed sons birthday party drunken stupor effective realism ryan brings situations 
diane keaton georgia better actress director wildly feeble compliment 
 little farfetched keaton distinctly older ryan kudrow although brief glimpses get children five years ryans senior 
yeah right 
lastly poor lisa kudrow wasted bigscreen venture even thin role s analyze 
kudrow isnt given enough time create full personality maddy isnt fault doesnt register quiet moments sprinkled throughout actually blessed given dialogue 
 anything though kudrow real talent anxiously await next time given role deserving time brilliantly nuanced oscarcaliber work s opposite sex 
 fan kudrows isnt favor rent gem puts good use kudrow sixty seconds hanging entirety 
 eves hardworking husband adam arkin predictably squandered role gives next nothing subplot reveals midway never mentioned 
cloris leachman ryan matthau makes small noticeable impression albeit brief appearance edie mcclurg rosycheeked woman lou affair christmas flashback manages one laughs otherwise joyless production 
nearly emotions displayed within hanging patently manufactured despite movie wanting viewer care characters aside eve want spoiled brats 
 bizarre twilight zone type reason find movie theater showing film suggestion hang opening credits 
saying waste time understatement epic proportions
