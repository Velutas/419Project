 kids hall acquired taste 
 took least season watching show hbo became believer 
maybe watching half dozen kids hall movies grow big screen 
 recommendation unless big fan kids skip film 
 firstand likely onlyattempt full length film lacks qualities made comedy work tv 
 bigbudget glossy production can make lack spontaneity permeates tv show 
 kids go motions get feeling arent really fun 
 makes difficult audience enjoy antics 
brain candy bunch skits tied together story pharmaceutical company develops new drug cure depression 
 typical sketchcomedy tradition actor plays several roles 
doctor cooper kevin mcdonald team create drug 
 pressure don roritor mark mckinney founder president roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases drug marketplace 
 ensuing distribution new happy pill throughout populace drives rest film 
 minutes brain candy still seems long 
 best thing sketch comedyand kids exceptionis ability quickly deliver laughs go another quick skit 
 additional setup necessary telling longer coherent story laughs just dont come fast enough 
strangely show even tame cable tv 
 movie makes several attempts risquenessmostly pointing gayness one scott thompsons charactersbut seem almost forced live pg rating 
one best bits though make use thompsons naked buttocks see charging battlegoing sex guys taking shower 
 classic genre monty python pulled delicate balancing act plot advancement punchline delivery holy grail 
 kids unfortunately task 
 amusing moments sure enough make experience enjoyable one
