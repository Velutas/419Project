 first exposure nightmare elm street series films one fact third installment first gain national theatrical release 
 didnt see first film much later 
 looking back original didnt hold lot great memories since didnt think much initially saw 
watching now second time confirmed overrated horror film ultimately makes sense whatsoever 
 know story now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns grave haunting dreams children burned alive years 
 first installment adequate job low budget theres absurd dialogue conceptual problems story 
plus movies ending understandably result studio wanting end film hook sequel renders rest film pointless 
 anyone understand happens nancys mother end film 
dont get wrong though 
 new generation horror films spurned away classics 
 horror movies released today just inane film 
horror difficult genre pull credibly nightmare elm street just doesnt cut 
 nightmare elm street available dvd new line home video 
 available single disc part nightmare elm street collection box set 
 film presented pan scan original theatrical aspect ratio although disc comes box set widescreen transfer provided 
 film digitally remastered includes two options audio mono mix new dolby digital mix 
also included dvd fulllength audio commentary track writerdirector wes craven stars john saxon heather langenkamp films director photography 
 extras include jump nightmare feature im sure can figure one usual cast crew bios films original press release kit notably leave robert englund johnny depp films original theatrical trailer 
 dvdrom features also included since dont dvdrom capabilities cant really get 
 commentary track entertaining informative nothing spectacular 
 first thing note commentary track special edition laserdisc years ago 
im saying thats negative thing just pointing 
everyone seems enthusiastic possible exception john saxon just doesnt say much 
 time youll forget hes even 
everyone else talks really quietly though reason theyre commenting scary movie need stay quiet possible 
 bonus disc boxed set called nightmare series encyclopedia features minutes worth interviews relating first film series 
also included original theatrical trailer two alternate endings film 
however can access one easily 
 hidden whats called labyrinth might possibly annoying feature dvd ever created 
basically interactive game sorts wander different nightmare locations looking objects give access extra little snippets footage interviews etc somewhere labyrinth second alternate ending film 
finding though chore bore
