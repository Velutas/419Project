synopsis aging master art thief supplier young buxom security consultant first appear convoluted mess involving risky heist millennium 
comments movie boring 
plain simple 
entrapment boring 
 stars sean connery can still carry action film despite age catherine zetajones likeable enough film presence ving rhames ultracool star pulp fiction mission impossible 
 takes full advantage yk computer bug fears current hot topic news storyline set end 
 genuinely wellstaged action sequences 
 went wrong 
plenty unfortunately 
 major problem entrapment script 
 beenthere donethat feel 
nothing seems particularly inventive original whole movie lacks suspense drags runs nearly two hours 
 screenwriters example periodically use countdown millennium means transition scenes e 
 days millennium 
 device used much effectively overlooked scifi film strange days 
 characters appear beginning neat first device wears thin umpteenth surprise revelation made 
entrapment words relies heavily audience knowing characters true motive resulting convoluted story leaves many scratching heads confusion 
 star power quite strong viewer cant help feel actors wasted production 
sean connery given mindnumbing lines never trust naked woman 
ving rhames character seems like afterthought hes developed 
 camera zooms frequently leeringly catherine zetajoness tight wardrobe 
 bad juvenile feel 
 least species movies hold bones fact theyre exploiting female body 
entrapment thin disguise plot development sean connery supposedly falls love girl watching tights arc pivot around laser beams 
 tagline movie reads trap set 
 sure spent money see movie 
entrapment really isnt bad watchable 
 suggest however one waits cable television see
