 dr alexander mccabe bob gunton response created evil bats 
alright folks stop youve heard one genetically altered animals wreak havoc town small band locals assisted specialist particular animals field must team stop mutant creatures can multiply spread across earth 
oh yeah military way bomb town well running short time 
sound familiar 
 plot destination films release bats 
dina meyer stars bat specialist sheila pulled research along annoying sidekick played irritating deftness leon order help small texas town figure local citizens animals chewed death recently 
 help local sheriff lou diamond phillips cdc official carlos jacott scientist bob gunton sheila discovers indeed bats genetically altered guntons character aggressive omnivorous order used military weapon 
 say knew exactly getting going film 
theres frame promotional footage seen film led believe going good 
 respect film never disappointed 
 film reaches level transcends bad good level borders downright insane 
 effects awful script contrived feature laughing things supposed taken seriously think 
 challenge anyone sit scene bat stalks baby crib another bat terrorizes patron eating diner straight face 
thankfully performances good can considering material actors perform 
dina meyer always highlight films johnny mnemonic dragonheart starship troopers 
 latter film batch actual merit one exception 
 one never really gets impression meyers character bat expert reality one never really cares doubt either 
 gives good performance expected plus shes nice look hour half 
lou diamond phillips also serviceable small town sheriff turned eventual hero 
although first meet character knows bats reason whats going town reason later suddenly becomes amazed learn actual cause deaths town bats 
 bad performance film leons 
 relegated im sticking around 
character proceeds repeat variations line majority film even though stays 
anyone cant immediately tell bob gunton bad guy patch adams countless films going eventually turn gang side creations eminent death will probably surprised highly doubt 
even hadnt villain just every film hes ever many obvious hints given indicate devious act holds shock whatsoever 
 fact death welcome finally starts moving plot towards finale 
 plot doesnt sound ridiculous yet check little tidbits multitude bats inexplicably disperses police officer cocks pistol 
 entire town disregards sheriff doctors orders stay indoors curfew instigated causing mass hysteria bats come full force killing several townsfolk 
 government official blows shelias instructions wait dawn install cooling unit bats cave will kill pulling night job resulting death entire military unit 
 cavern full bat feces never ignites phosphorus flare lit right middle 
finally top little texas town showing nosferatu single screen theater reference town million people nearly movie screens lucky even get kevin smiths dogma 
 laughable part movie though comes illconceived bat puppets 
 actual bat attack scenes shot rapid fire editing making scenes nearly impossible comprehend whats going scenes bat called upon interact live actor usually shot lowkey 
therefore audience get loving closeups unrealistic rubbery bat puppets ever committed film 
 able see puppeteers arms things made creations worse 
 still decide bats might movie dont say havent warned 
trust say lot fun trash sit 
 just wish dina meyer cast roles least choose better films appear 
shes definitely talent going waste films like
