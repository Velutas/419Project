 one point movie staging opera goes completely wrong 
 one member crowd stands cheers thinking performance planned applauding efforts 
thats dirty work nutshell 
 different kind movie 
 movie can easily review 
 critic analyzes structure plot acting characters 
 
 
tells movie terrible 
 norm macdonald fan rolling floor laughing 
 movie plays like hbo sketch comedy movie 
 one note concept 
mitch sam need order bribe doctor give father heart transplant needy patients 
realizing good revenge plots open revenge hire business eventually running afoul rich businessman played christopher macdonald roles happy gilmore veronicas closet seems typcast role sends destroy building mitch learns home girlfriends grandmother thus leading plot rich businessman night grand opening new opera house 
first critic 
 plot standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device main character meets girl dreams along way 
heres catch 
none characters sympathetic 
theyre selfish jerks dont care hurt attempts whatever want 
 jokes juvenile crude appealing worst elements people 
theres jokes prostitutes homeless beastiality anal sex 
theres even subplot thats developed seems make jokes infidelity incest 
 loved watching 
 huge fan norm macdonalds sarcastic tothepoint comedy saturday night live movie hour half 
norm macdonald takes joke strips core tells like dry wit 
like scene friend learning ropes new construction job 
 foreman goes basics mitch sam dont understand 
 get 
 admiting lied resumes dont know thing construction 
 surprise get fired 
 characters incredibly meanspirited 
theres father whos loud obnoxious gambling addicted doctor played chevy chase tells sam fathers condition saying gambling man id put lot money death 
 businessman cole always dog spunky knows 
 theres mitch sam thinking can get destroying building ponder actions ruin lives residents 
 bad mitch says 
heres movie every joke executed set see every punchline coming every spot profanity used used 
 least film honest makes mistake anything idiotic 
 least isnt dull isnt predictable 
 thats way 
 sketch comedy youre fan norm macdonald youll love 
 jokes crude characters mean core attitude movie just doesnt care 
 dont like norm macdonald stupid movies probably wont like one 
 jokes crude characters mean core attitude movie just doesnt care 
 seeing one tune mindset prepare slew norm macdonald humor gay animal sex prison rape jokes uncaring characters one last performance chris farley
