dr dolittle th century fox running time hour minutes starring eddie murphy directed betty thomas riding high success nutty professor murphy returns abysmal comedy 
 plays doctor john dolittle child ability understand animals 
however exorcised loses ability fast forward see dolittle crummy job surrounding crummy people notably dr mark weller played oliver platt 
however bonk head ability understand animals returns comedy ready waiting happen 
except comedy never happen 
doctor dolittle even excellent premise rarely manages raise laugh 
poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout whole movie performance suffers 
 manic murphy saw s gone mature boring twin appears getting work s 
 voices animals include albert brooks chris rock new eddie murphy norm mcdonald lucky dog marginally better least put enthusiasm movie 
sadly lines pretty dumb 
 theyre funny dumb like dumb dumber just boring dumb 
 film even succumbs fart jokes halfway desperate attempt raise laughs 
 good jokes script far 
 choose favourite performance probably albert brooks tiger certain charm 
sadly hes barely movie rocks really annoying hamster given far much screen time 
joke wise thankfully spared mocking insulting type jokes featured heavily nutty professor 
 director betty thomas well done better films 
 bought us private parts brady bunch movie sadly much better 
 scenes lack charm just gets job done 
 animals reasonable realistic although obviously puppets 
theres impressive looking tiger however lip sync pretty good 
youd problem guessing close ups puppets however jilted movement 
 hoping jim hensons workshop created furry friends done better job 
doctor dolittle end disappointment everyone involved 
murphy done much better movies e 
trading places director seen better days even creatures arent good 
 target audience aged undemanding will probably like however thanks dumbed humour 
everyone else however give doctor dolittle miss
