 feel hesitation saying theres something mary best film will see year 
 moment credits started roll end picture doubt mind seen masterpiece will remain unsurpassed remaining months 
 good film 
 gene siskel said fargo months dismissed notion ridiculous 
 possibly know film great nothing possibly see future beat 
 seeing farrellys hilarious surprisingly heartfelt masterwork now know siskel talking 
 great film comes along daring brilliant simply enjoyable end just want stand cheer 
 know instant just experienced something special 
now shocker mary grossest disgusting film ever viewed pink flamingos obviously notwithstanding 
 movie rude guess inappropriate nature hard time sitting theater watching parents luckily seen warn 
forget blazing saddles animal house even former king grossout comedy monty pythons meaning life preludes farrellys assault senses 
 fact may even funniest film ive ever pleasure seeing real contender monty python holy grail certainly hilarious come decade 
 funny something also said overall sweetness mary huge heart 
 see farrellys truly gifted filmmakers 
 dont just present string dick fart jokes although plenty go around 
 also wisely add unbelievable amount charisma main characters actually develop story progresses 
 funny though 
 just look outline story seems kind contrived predictable 
 believe anything 
ben stiller plays ted shy clumsy teenage geek lusts school babe mary cameron diaz 
 sticks retarded brother warren w 
early brown cameraman believe scream dreams come true invites prom 
 one films funniest scenes something goes wrong wont ruin know nothing film ted unable face mary ever 
jump present 
 years selfloathing ted finally hires private detective pat healy suitably slimy matt dillon track can one last chance winning woman loved since high school 
healy finds mary still fullblown hottie decides try keep 
admittingly basic story line leaves little desired 
 notreallyallthatfunny premise can sustain laughter nearly two hours 
somehow farrellys pull 
 performances also right target 
 ted stiller adds just right amount clumsy charm make character irritating normally lovable 
 cameron diaz perfect role obvious reasons actor really grabs attention w earl brown marys brother 
 actor even come close playing mentally retarded man much natural ease brown displays 
 know wont nominated guy counted comes time hand oscar nods february 
 good actors though directors movie way 
 guarantee almost every top ten list end year will see number one space occupied steven spielbergs wwii epic saving private ryan 
 yes great film worthy recognition getting 
 harder making great war film audience laugh hard cant breath minutes time 
ill let decide one critic sticking guns 
 just something mary
