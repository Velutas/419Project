perhaps time say little reading habits 
 really like read ive enjoyed many books lifetime 
 problem im slow reader dedicated ill enjoy portions book set months time taken last six weeks get first one hundred pages anna karenina even though im loving book 
 addition typically dont read anything created th century 
 reason bother bit information feel bad admitting time time havent read books films based exception believe great expectations 
however dont think necessary read book beforehand order judge quality film 
needless say havent read elmore leonard novel sight steven soderberghs new film based 
 cant say faithful adaptation lives leonards vision 
 can say terrific film sharp acting great dialogue pumping full energy style injected soderbergh 
 certainly nice distraction s lineup brainless blockbusters hopelessly wishing size mattered 
 sight proves doesnt 
 originally written george clooney onenote actor incapable depth occasionally showing little flair 
 seeing latest performance film ive changed mind guy can act also forceful presence certainly will make one million superstars 
 plays jack foley middle aged guy robs banks living 
 fun think film opens getting caught car wont start 
 goes jail interesting break five cinematic minutes later help friend buddy ving rhames 
 introduced karen sisco jennifer lopez u s marshall conveniently waiting shotgun jack escapes 
fortunately take hostage jack spend quality time trunk together buddy drives safety 
 central conflict arises jack karen become obsessed one another though respective jobs make superficially incompatible 
 soon learn film told sequence since gritty crime comedy flashbacks pulp fiction arise 
 first kind felt gimmick guess gimmick pulp fiction 
 fun gimmick though soderbergh treats material enough humor everything comes naturally 
ive seen soderberghs films impressed kafka sex lies videotape think hes excellent 
hes artist without making obvious without pretentious always admirable 
 uses tricks yes lots freezeframe stuff adds smooth quirky currents film 
 said clooney terrific hes matched lopez 
lopez course beautiful can act 
 can sense shes honing skills comes natural previous ventures stone gave much help loathsome uturn 
 two actors arresting chemistry one another best scene film far seduction scene 
 brilliance scene also due part soderbergh cuts back forth quiet discussion bar physical act takes place minutes later 
 scene series soft nuances glances layered upon light dialogue result one better love scenes recent cinema meaningful engrossing 
 supporting cast strong led alwaysreliable ving rhames 
dennis farina plays karens father good don cheadle profoundly stupid villain 
steve zahn plays jacks nearlybrain dead accomplice glenn steals scenes thats film every scene already high level 
 actors helped dialogue intelligentlyconstructed script scott frank 
 sight certainly light film although heavy moments will linger memory 
overall can recommend simply great entertainment 
 every film change life nice see movie uses art tell great story simply entertain viewers 
 book film good enough make believe might something text worth looking
