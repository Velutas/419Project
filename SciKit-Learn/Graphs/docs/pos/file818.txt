many reviewers taken politicallycorrect stance movie uses naked ladies scenery bad thing miss fact movie naked ladies people environment naked ladies common environment exist 
 scum use people powertrip toys need escape power 
 world sex nothing normal human values dont pertain lack sexual excitement passionate heat even blatant scenes something accomplishment 
 nc movie isnt sexually exciting says great deal phoniness emptiness social stratum sex robbed kind beauty power value 
 one scene movie good sex scene berkley maclachlan swimming pool exciting already know character callous manipulator 
 anything rape scene victim whos duped cooperation 
 dont make movie history black people america without using black actors dont make movie world war ii without guns going people getting killed dont make movie las vegas showgirls without showing las vegas showgirls 
 awful lot vegas shows awful lot ladies wear little clothing 
 legitimate portrayal rather seamy side entertainment industry town sex simply negotiable commodity 
showgirls deglamorizes las vegas show sex industries great effectiveness 
nomi played good performance elizabeth berkley gives us solid picture woman limited talents whos end rope desperate live life better one shes known 
 nothing market except body limited dancing ability trying desperately hooker trying something better seems destined 
 nomi realizes shes gone far little catches just time save essential part wants 
gina rivera plays molly dressmaker costumer befriends nomi providing may one solid positive relationship nomis entire life 
molly one makes difference provides role model framework nomi needs verify value system shell using rest life nomis feelings molly spur forces nomis decision 
gina gershon plays cristal aging still attractive starring dancer reflexively competitive manipulator whos become villainess internalizing ethos crooks scum around 
gershon plays cristal cross ava gardner raquel welch fading talent made bitter selfawareness 
 character well drawn performed major scene hospital room acknowledges essence passes torch nomi 
 relationship two honest one movie provides part impetus nomi needs follow different path 
 accident three important parts movie women different stripe molly honest hardworking person means well nearly dies confuses glitter image reality 
cristal talented dancer whos compromised ideals sold cooperating part system exchanging selfrespect species stardom can las vegas 
nomi believes can make without selling succumbs degree realizes can make without selling doesnt need las vegas brand stardom 
 male parts movie simply props exist demonstrate explicate cultural milieu showgirls exist 
kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work inhumanly emotionless cop hidden gives us nicely reptilian bit pond scum two legs camouflaged nice guy 
glenn plummer plays dancer whos working bellboy provides bit alternate perspective 
plummers character one movie whos maintaining interest dance performing art even hes succumbed cult manipulation 
plummers character closest thing sympathetic male character whole movie 
 jost vacanos cinematography fantastic one particular delineation nomis character alteration nodialog scene using nothing color changes lighting utterly terrifying 
 movie rated nc due language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence probably costuming well 
 dont see way particular story told well without regard legitimate exercise moviemaking 
 dont go see youre tough mood person possible like movie ends c u 
 life support probably one character movie youd enjoy meeting person
