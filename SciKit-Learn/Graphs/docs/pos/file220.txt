just ask paul vitti robert deniro man finds job mafia head rather stress inducing 
 can believe one cant even begin fathom turmoil must go hes forced choose ice pick baseball bat sledgehammer torture victims 
suffering reoccurring panic attacks paul decides needs consult professional help 
 better billy crystal 
 appearing bottomofthebarrel flops fathers day giant crystal finally finds reliable costar promising material 
playing vittis private shrink two different stars strike unorthodox interesting relationship carries enjoyable comedy steady wave laughs start finish 
casting robert deniro paul vitti something injoke think 
placed mobsters shoes deniro gets spoof characters played films like godfather part ii casino 
 obvious hes lot fun 
 man behind camera harold ramis whose credits include ghostbusters writer star best directing effort bill murray vehicle groundhog day 
ramis knack drawing laughs simply knows whats funny manages accentuate strengths nearly actors 
 character weakens payoff crystals bridetobe lisa kudrow 
playing dumbeddown role friends kudrow amusing doesnt fit comedy mold well director may hoped 
 supporting cast sparkles 
joe viterelli hilarious jelly vittis pea brained righthand man chazz palminteri show stopper playing fellow mobster whos desperate need definition closure 
 movie manages maintain consistent chuckles throughout putting emphasis really big laughs will audiences grasping sides
