 fully loaded entertainment review website coming july 
 ace ventura truman burbank jim carrey run whole gamut comic yet sympathetic characters 
s cable guy supposed big breakthrough role zany humor darker dramatic acting 
 everyone knows results well lessthanstellar 
 film hot box office also panned critics 
 far know gene siskel ones willing admit dug 
 first time saw cable guy theatres super criticmode didnt really like 
however due fact hbo shows movie every single day ive time lean back relax take film 
 surprise grew 
 plot rather simple broderick plays guy named steven befriends cable guy played carrey stalked steven tries break relationship 
see stevens problems girlfriend robin leslie mann doesnt think room life new friend 
also cable guys antics creeping 
carrey cable guy gives steven various aliases later find tv characters larry tate chip douglas ricky ricardo etc apparently lives cable van many critics didnt enjoy newer darker lessmanic performance carrey thought interesting rather welldone 
 movie whole thats enjoyable rather several individual scenes karaoke jam stevens apartment medieval fight theme restaurant bathroom beating la liar liar just name 
perhaps fact carreys humorous side comes scenes makes funny 
 really want see something youve got hear version jefferson airplanes somebody love sung aformentioned karaoke jam 
 cable guy bad spots like movie 
 didnt particularly like stevens girlfriend felt focus used relationship steven best friend 
also ending fooled moment rather contrived somewhat dissapointing 
still found cable guy worthwhile venture youre video store cant think anything rent suggest try 
 hbo just wait till comes wont wait long 
hell thats every day
