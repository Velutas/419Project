 look movie necessarily perfection 
sometimes movie strong ideas despite whatever flaws may will prefer bettermade film thoughtprovoking 
 thin red line flawed provokes 
terence malick returns filmmaking years days heaven produces meditative look war 
unlike years saving private ryan dwells war necessary evil explores moral ambiguities thereof thin red line simply says war waste 
 might seem obvious experiencing film realize profound waste 
saving private ryan underlying practical acceptance war will occur great cost thin red line says idealistically avoid costs 
one message necessarily correct 
 just depends ones point view 
 malicks film war set tropical paradise john tolls cinematography beyond lush 
 setting poses question fighting face beauty 
 saving private ryan capture german soldier presents moral quandary whether let go 
 thin red line japanese present moral quandary war first place 
 just like americans frightened angry grieving praying 
 separates war 
 flaw thin red line comes voiceovers 
unbelievable coming characters sometimes pretentious sometimes corny voiceovers tell us images us already completely unnecessary 
dispensing malick achieved tarkovskian grandeur 
instead gets distracting selfconsciousness 
aside malicks direction stunning 
 tracking shots across windswept hills around transports speeding toward shore extraordinary 
sean penn elias koteas nick nolte give best performances 
penn subtle sergeant trying hide humanism koteas genuine compassionate captain nolte startling colonel whose blood vessels burst win battle 
john travolta george clooney worst cameo roles 
ultimately however thin red lines interest characters drama 
 frequently criticized lack dramatic structure malick clearly different things mind 
 one ever thought getting dramatic entertainment war exploitative 
 malick working theme thin red line provoking
