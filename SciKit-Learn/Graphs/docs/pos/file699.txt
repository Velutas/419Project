 fear resulting fact terrorist may strike anyone even total innocents anywhere anytime gives figure label 
edward zwicks siege explores possibility kind violence taking place right united states 
youd think opening bit ripped right headlines 
arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad u s responds retaliating sheik supposedly ordered attack 
however unlike reallife tomahawk cruise missile strike bin ladens camp manufacturing facility film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal 
 retaliation terrorists bring fight new world 
unwittingly involved fbi assistant special agentincharge anthony hubbard denzel washington works bureaus new york office one federal plaza 
 investigating series bombings big apple encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying uncover information 
generally fbi charged problems inside u s cia takes care problems international realm 
even spies countries limits cia long country 
hubbard therefore finds highly unusual agency spook nosing around considers territory two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes aware increasingly complicated series allegiances possibly illegal actions involving terrorism united states government 
 original tagline patriot games never terrorist attack american soil 
however true pulled movies release sounded much like dare 
revisiting scenario foreign terrorists committing acts violence united states siege almost invitation shows just kind turmoil produced effective terrorist network set operations america 
admittedly terror wrought upon new york bit excessive whos going believe bombs going cause new yorkers jump backfire bus curtail shopping twothirds basic premise still valid 
 liked fact film rises basic actionthriller fare good guy gmen bad guy terrorists exploring effects society law order 
 provides possible hypothesis violent activity part arabs escalate series hate crimes arabamerican population effort find terrorists civil liberties minority may violated government 
 fact halfway film president authorizes declaration martial law within new york city liberties americans put risk 
although may actually side effect terrorist campaign demise social order america scary thought goal beneath many international terrorist groups 
throughout film maintains conflict hubbard wants use fbi pursue terrorists within letter law general devereaux bruce willis command army mind greater good better served suspending law pursuing terrorists forcefully 
 results fascinating debate appropriateness constitutionality declaration martial law invocation war powers act utilizing philosophy historical examples make points sides 
 actually gets rather heady times credit screenwriters zwick lawrence wright menno meyjes dont underestimate intelligence audience 
 dont know tone inflection something else denzel washington way spitting dialog makes whatever says sound great 
 combined innate acting ability experience playing midlevel authority figure makes performance siege convincing enjoyable 
annette bening gives one assertive portrayals female character ive seen recently chemistry shares washington palpable 
 somewhat unfortunate characters fortitude broken certain point allows us watch bening play little range 
bruce willis pretty much relegated toughguy role always standing straight permanent scowl fixed upon face 
however tension exists devereaux hubbard major drive behind films development 
notable tony shalhoub plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant 
 role calls evidencing kind filial pride heritage contempt race might interfere integration american society 
difficult say least shalhoub naturalness can almost reach touch 
perhaps best known role antonio cab driver nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety dramatic abilities wonderful film big night 
whereas denzel washington seems edward zwicks favorite actor directed washington glory courage fire james horner seems favorite composer 
 therefore found odd zwick chose prolific scorewriter graeme revell seven films year already horner siege realized film contained lot arabianthemed music horners record shown propensity scores either neutral ethnicity irishsounding 
revell good job providing appropriate music punctuate key scenes allowing score enhance movie whole 
 nowhere near intrusive films weve getting throughout year 
missteps siege can found couple excesses takes 
 example pretty clear throughout film meant thriller action flick 
unfortunately theres scene army just cuts loose arab immigrants blatant display firepower explosions obviously meant sole purpose eyecatching 
 middle city real opposition zwick even army use cobra attack helicopter shoot rockets building farther feet friendly troops 
verisimilitude really goes window point 
 film also gets little preachy toward end focusing ability different races get along 
 noble gesture film just puts message across bit obviously 
 flaws glaring dont detract much otherwise good film makes think issues may considered since history class
