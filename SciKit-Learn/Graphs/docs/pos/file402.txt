 brief film needs introduction 
 havent heard must space sabbatical havent seen well suspect youre small minority 
first things first hyped 
well yes 
 good film theres lot like without problems 
 saw first trailer titanic went see bean last summer think intial reaction aint downright sick make disaster movie dreadful reallife tragedy 
 mean whats happened hollywoods scriptwriters run entirely new ideas 
gads whatever next asked action film based hiroshima starring jean claude van damme 
 entirely filled anticipation wasnt alone respect 
 came cinema rave reviews well mostly anyone whod see seemed disturbingly obsessed started take notice 
 didnt see film several months release time sister seen four times 
 went slightly open mind still didnt think id enjoy much 
 yes 
mainly yes im happy say 
 first hour beautifully done much scripting ill talk later recreated ship sets stunning look camerons directing performances principal cast strong human aspect story romance rose kate winslet jack leonardo dicaprio enchanting 
 film told via flashback gloria stuart playing elderly rose modern day knew course 
 
well often effective device use storytelling though sometimes can fall flat 
 work 
 script form doesnt add much story 
 add lot story gloria stuart whose stunning performance strongest moving film 
 presence brings much deeper level passion depth story though appearances relatively brief film suffered without 
also impressive dicaprio winslet wholly succeed rising often poor dialogue bond form heartfelt moving 
 old story know forbidden love ala romeo juliet works jacks rescuing rose literal figurative senses teaching live life counts pointed touching 
 fact enjoyed first half film lot largely winslet dicaprio bring charm energy romance 
 engaging touching enjoyable 
theres tinge poignancy well simply know going happy ending 
 leads us second half film 
 knew coming 
im sure director cameron looking forward eager anticipation hes stated interviews real thrust story sinking jackrose romance merely manipulative plot device get emotionally film 
 think understates importance romance found far enjoyable hour watching people die 
 iceberg arrives captain announces titanic will sunk hour 
 hour 
 goodness dont miss second hour 
gratuitous well perhaps todays standards im sure theres far worse produced banner entertainment films 
 certainly wasnt prepared shocking graphic last hour 
 id expect word understatement part camerons vocabulary brought us umm vivid films terminator aliens 
 overdone 
 thought 
understatement can sometimes work wonders conveying tragedy 
 one expected happy ending didnt quite expect horrendously shocking powerful scenes bombarded throughout films second half 
still whether overdone heavyhanded shockfactor cameron worked shocked moved fact spent last hour tears 
 really couldnt help get emotionally involved whether wishing someone knock dreadfully psychotic fiance roses overboard desperately hoping rose rescue jack jack rescue rose survive 
perhaps harrowing scene ship sunk sunk along ship freeze death water surface 
 bit rose lets go jacks hand promising shell never let go heart particularly heartwrenching sight rescue boats sailing amid ocean corpses pretty powerful image put fine point 
 loved ending however moving slightly uplifting following horror past hour half 
 weve established film powerful moving last hour rather excessive 
havent mentioned script 
plotwise ok though jackrose relationship beautifully developed ive feeling thats actors credit anything 
 dialogue well titanic set 
 period drama 
 saw little indication period far dialogue concerned 
 really use phrases like goddamn 
back turn century 
 doubt 
 someone talk like ya love guy 
 doubt 
 dialogue saw iceberg see eyes now just bit clumsy 
yes 
 little attention dialogue gone astray cameron blame wrote script 
stick directing dude 
 redeemed acting dicaprio winslet fine form ably supported strong cast 
star show gloria stuart though didnt win oscar 
 throwing oscars titanic left right centre gloria perhaps deserving nominee 
directingwise cameron spectacular job 
like said vision bit excessive least directed well 
 havent even mentioned james horners beautiful score 
utterly heavenly though dad sister play soundtrack lot start get bit bored 
 
ive finished rant lasted lot longer thought 
just leaves couple questions worth oscars 
hell dont talk oscars 
bloomin farce 
 deserving number departments though 
last question suggest one best films alltime 
nope dont think 
 certainly one powerful memorable films ive ever seen dont think quite ranks one alltime favourites 
 fact theyre reportedly making titanic well guess thats typical hollywood
