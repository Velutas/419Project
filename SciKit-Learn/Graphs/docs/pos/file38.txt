people waited twentytwo years prequel star wars diehard fans camping theaters months get tickets see 
 dont think america will ever actually recover hurricane film caused 
 bit exaggeration say highly anticipated movie history 
anyone tells just movie either lying clueless 
 clearly obvious waiting hype actually seeing movie will anticlimactic 
 second coming lord live kind buzz far weak word star wars epsode phantom menace effortlessly generated 
 mean film bad 
 fact terrific 
 strongly suspect many people dissappointed simply surrendered media machine inevitable backlash 
 set decades events original star wars took place 
 film focuses fledgling republic planets conflict raging trade federation angry tax raise recently put place invaded small peaceful planet naboo

 selfrespecting star wars fan know anakin will grow darth vader give birth luke skywalker 
 beginning evident actors movie 
around characters computer generated one form another though effects seamless movie lacks soul 
 think although computer played incredibly instrumental part moviemaking decade cinema still human art phantom menace nearly defies 
 lightest installment star wars saga thus far plenty broad comic relief go around much courtesy irritating knew character named jarjar binks 
hes essentially computeranimated sidekick says things like exqueeze 
 mesa go now okeday although often amusing also inherently annoying 
 visual effects astounding although director george lucas often chickens cutting away movie thrilling triumph 
 lacks plot acting makes imagination excitement 
 climactic lightsaber battle oh come didnt already know among things outrageously entertaining defines term popcorn movie 
 made surrender give movie stars score john williams 
even though seem like man scores every single movie comes days work nothing short brilliant 
 use opera climax really add punch ingenious way utilizing imperial march sort prophecy chilling 
 phantom menace probably effective pop nostalgia 
 see long time ago galaxy far far away familiar music plays words star wars appear screen youll feel tingle even didnt see movie first came 
 feels oddly exciting introduced young anakin boy whose innocence know will taken away will soon cross dark side 
 perfect example dramatic irony see jedi masters aspire get trained jedi arts know will harm good 
 feel involved story feel like seeing beginning saga cherished years 
 phantom menace although lacking human aspects story worthy installment star wars 
 works action flick visually eyepopping often paralyzingly exciting also works elicitor memories piece exquisite nostalgia
