happy viewer 
 minute thought going groaning release disneys latest another adaptation legend past 
 remember pathetic pocahontas 
yikes 
 guess disney company thats roll lately animated films strikes another wonderful tale pleases eyes well inner kid 
 story pretty basic tarzan left orphaned female gorilla whos lost young adopts group 
 matures much older man tarzan still wonders just hes much different clan arrives hunter professor professors lovely daughter jane meets tarzan rather quickly getting trouble group feisty babboons 
 tarzan faces tough choices stay ones grew go join kind england 
 voicework pretty toplevel 
tony goldwyn convincing ape man minnie driver adds delectable touch alreadybeautiful jane nigel hawthorne makes pretty nasty hunter voice rosie o donnell keeps laughs rolling tarzans best ape friend terk wayne newman knight moments panicky elephant 
 movie superb throughout mixing great script incredible computerassisted visuals 
 tarzan treesurfs twist added top ol vine swinging great one might add camera twists turns allowing trees around come life vividly 
 couldnt believe eyes disney come long way since starting ballroom beauty beast 
 musics half bad either 
fortunately theres ridiculous singing characters just great set songs phil collins perfectly fit mood 
theres great action sequences well including wonderfully done chase tarzan jane aforementioned babboons 
 course action theres message well family 
 easily one disneys best animated films decade one cant wait put home library
