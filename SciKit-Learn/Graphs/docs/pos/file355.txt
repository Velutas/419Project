 anxious see long time 
 friend mine recommended crush neve campbell wanted prove shes hot thinks 
 proved right reasons enjoy film go way beyond 
scream treads familar ground horror movie star neve campbell puts stupid killer stalking big breasted girl cant act whos always running stairs running front door 
 familar typical horror film 
 may ask watching seem new original 
 treats hasnt done thus viewer disilusioned believing old familar tired stuff 
 raises another question 
simple characters 
theyre typical stupid horror film victims dont know hell chased guy ski mask machette 
 horror fans know stuff happens horror movie know makes scary even funny certain times 
 can tell just watching opening scene casey becker drew barrymore making popcorn getting ready watch video guy sounds like killer calls play game involves horror movie triva gets wrong will get boyfriend killed 
 knows answer asks horror film questions just cant answer final question door 
 gets killed 
 scene works normal horror film half things happen scene never happen 
 plot typical horror stuff sidney prescott impressive neve campbell attractive young high school student whos mother killed year ago tommorrow stalked killer whos previously murdered one classmates casey naturally everybody small california town suspect including sidneys boyfriend billy loomis 
 said people know horror movies work thats makes appealing 
 references horror movies like casey says first nightmare elm street scary rest sucked 
 obviously director wes craven good job poking fun genre made legend patting back directed first nightmare movie none others tatum sidneys friend mentions director wes carpenter obviously homage writer kevin williamson craven also director john carpenter 
 cast well chosen neve campbell pulls good heroine unlike horror film heroines can act drew barrymore good janet leigh impression little time film david arquette impressive 
also good funny role henry winkler fonz school principal 
 took half point unnecessary albeit limited appearance friends courteney cox reporter gail edwards sidneys rival covered mothers disappearance 
 hate show hate actors 
theyre untalented overexposed overpaid imho think wes craven smart enough know actors overexposed enough suppose isnt
