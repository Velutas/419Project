theater rating good seats sound picture 
 realize every time encounter new person youve just become part story 
everyone life story past present every time two interact become part others story necessarily important even significant part part nevertheless 
 seems basic theory behind go several characters chance encounters effect extreme ways 
 order test theory screenwriter john august director doug liman assemble cast characters wouldnt usually types entire film revolve around teenage supermarket cashier bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer two struggling soap opera actors 
 types characters might sound original consider will somehow effected strip club bouncer psychotic father midlevel drug dealer narc obsessed multilevelmarketing horny wedding guests zen lovemaker two shrimpscarfers cute normal teenage girl round things 
 will come together process film deals 
id imagine concept film started creators testing see actually pull outcome terrific achievement filmmaking craft fiction general 
 film starts anything else little indication whats come 
 meet ronna polley depressed los angeles checkout girl doesnt seem much desire anything except work just pay rent 
shes charming especially customers played mostly laughs rather characterization works 
maybe shes afeminite character shes far masculine creative character indeed 
things start progress ronna reluctantly agrees take hours goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew english teen vices sake experiences 
 agreement starts threepronged storyline allows simon go las vegas weekend friends turn drags ronna friends buying selling experimental drug 
 process will bring ronna close arrested also death 
nearly can said two characters zack mohr adam wolf dont think much first appear supporting characters later will become major players films makeup another process used filmmakers elaborate theory significant insignificant interaction might 
 pace picked film really begins show mettle 
 title screen ronna flashed shortly aforementioned turning point scene clear film isnt going employ standard linear method storytelling 
considering good point long overdue change pace needed movies today 
 film begins take shape first following ronna friends onenight adventure begins drug deal instigated zack adam actually looking simon doesnt exactly go planned thats keeps interesting 
 second storyline starts moment ronnas story time camera chooses follow simon instead 
simon three friends head vegas night town process experience things never imagined 
 third arc zack adam overlaps ronnas story telling much story completely different angle 
 shown things never expected going following ronna 
 many events happen ronna zack adam arent even fault just happened 
id really like dissect three storylines especially film wraps end take much time space spoil everything havent seen film 
perhaps greatest element film constant surprises unpredictability due plot twists confusing screenplay just great filmmaking 
still can list analyze nearly everything film well 
 direction trying piece together complex story easy task rookie filmmaker liman great accomplishment 
 doesnt just depict story wraps us pulling us fray experience every high low 
 screenplay besides chiseled detail creative general clear script inspired many sources obvious subtle references yet never screams ripoff 
 tonemood hollywood films failed bring charm independents mainstream one able create sense macabre 
 overlydark twisted comedy isnt satirical considered black comedy like macabre light 
 cinematographyart direction able photograph intense lighthearted manner 
 characterization nearly every character introduced matter role play big picture able get sense theyre thinking came situations 
even actions surprising never seems synch 
 performances every actor nails role see 
 themetheory film doesnt seem concerned conveying kind political social messages instead philosophical experiment 
 fact might meant intentionally definitely something existential 
 think go just big comedy adventure
