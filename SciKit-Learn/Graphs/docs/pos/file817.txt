 review theres something mary said something effect laughter isnt everything 
 now need make brief addendum postulate laughter isnt everything unless im watching jim abrahams film 
see spoofs easy 
 love movies love movies make fun movies love 
sometimes im one theater laughing 
sometimes laugh hard embarass laugh highpitched comparison speaking voice cuts right everyone elses laughter 
sometimes laugh much cheekbones sore end film 
abrahams latest film mafia induced kind hysteria upon 
 gotten mediocre reviews hey im guy laughs everything 
 may lot jokes flop film far work laughed frequently failed jokes usually occurred recovering previous bout giddy madness 
 enjoy films like one second serious thoughtprovoking 
 lighweight films pose comedies try things like develop characters shape stories nonsense 
mafia 
 pretentions characters story exists reason make people laugh 
 film begins perfect high note mockery opening casino 
 hero jay mohr seen walking casino getting car subsequently explodes sends flying air backdrop flowing fire 
 describe story mafia 
 absurd pointless will mention basically follows framework godfather films lot casino references inserted throughout 
along way parodies seem arbitrary rarely victimize mob films pictures like english patient forrest gump jaws undergo severe hilarious bashing 
movies like rely just things important element direction 
abrahams path many times hot shots top secret airplane film exclamation point title hold success mafia 
 experience 
 takes just right attitude scene manages wring least bit laughter even oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like wants make fun titanic never develops 
 actors energetic helps lot tone film 
mohr suicide kings paulie quickly becoming one favorite actors good 
 looks like hes much fun hes containing laughter every scene watch face sequence swimming pool 
hes probably performer cast manages urge laughter without help material 
lloyd bridges decent imitation brandos godfather pamela gidley deadon fullblown mockery sharon stone 
 hard thing writing reviews comedies im supposed give examples things specific 
unfortunately constantly blindsided laughter mafia 
 cant remember lot made laugh 
 thats good sign mafia 
 funny wasnt even given time apply scenes memory 
 laughed hard shut brain 
 know doesnt sound particularly complimentary watching dumb comedy like first thing want shut brain 
finally film
