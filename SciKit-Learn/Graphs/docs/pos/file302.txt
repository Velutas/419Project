 jekyll hyde story told maids point view word dark 
 wouldnt expect something bright cheery based robert louis stevensons novel film surprisingly dreary dismal 
jekyllhyde john malkovich terminally depressed desperate 
mary reilly julia roberts victim monstrous child abuse antiwoman sentiment times 
director stephen fears version london slums makes us marvel anyone survived 
 lighting level exceedingly low throughout movie almost appears filmed black white 
 direction cinematography brilliant liquid 
scenes flow next scene like honey oozing strawberry 
 except theres red course 
 look moody melodramatic youll shocked leave theater 
 saw matinee took quite adjust sunny skies afterward 
often jekyll hyde archetypes viewed splitting whole person components good evil perhaps cerebral emotional parts 
 doctor intellectual perhaps good certainly powerless 
 alter ego forceful totally without conscience 
two parts make whole 
neither capable functioning without separated disaster inevitable 
 differences two characters effective accomplished demeanor attitude 
 finally see transformation special effects thrust story realm science fiction psychological horror tale demands 
roberts malkovich skillful roles 
 suitably melancholy fitting rest film 
 flash life color comes glenn close lips madam whorehouse hyde lives surprisingly jekyll apparently frequents 
life color maybe closes best role 
 seems little cardboard cutout character 
 beautiful film dreary way 
youll appreciate filmmaking craft dont expect leave upbeat mood
