 wonder boys michael douglas plays aged writer professor livedin naturalism believe may best performance 
ever since wall street douglas spent greater part career playing variations shark suit gordon gecko character personified mids 
 performances tended exaggerate vehemence cutthroat businessmen much frothing mouth projecting bad intentions world 
youd think man keep evil wrapped tightly underneath goodnatured veneer gordon gecko nicholas van orton douglas played role straight open 
 wonder boys performance isnt showy tour de force simple yet truthful 
 embodies grady craggy old writer predilection pot pink bathrobes 
grady instructs writers workshop working tirelessly follow novel put map 
 first encounter curmudgeon midst workshop hear sardonic narration soundtrack students bombard one unfair criticisms 
grady points narration jealousy 
 target writerly named james leer played always understated tobey maguire student full potential one grady develops mild affection 
leer kind youth seems mechanically block emotions 
 speaks intellectualized monotone just hint dry wit around edges 
hes portentous gloomy modeling great depressed writers though act little calculated 
 reminds selfimposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog 
whenever happen catch jarmusch interview see man speaking toneless manner monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth contempt interviewer exclusively dressed black spiked hair dyed snow white 
leer similar guy equates quirks depth 
tobey maguire fits well role 
 round sweeteerie face resembles bud cort harold maude 
 unlike cort maguire easier warm hes messed kid reaching artistic credibility 
katie holmes plays hannah beautiful talented writing student just itching get gradys pants 
 plot line trouble 
douglas old age beginning resemble jerry springer man actually paid sex numerous documented occasions 
 first found extremely difficult believe someone beautiful hannah desire grady maybe im jealous wish holmes throwing may just lowly internet critic least still teeth think douglass real life companion breathtaking catherine zeta jones 
seeing two together looks lot like kidnapping 
suddenly mind shifted task hand reviewing completely wonderful movie im pontificating hell jones desire douglas 
 movie somewhere 
grady rather chivalrously ask resists charms hannah sara gaskell droll frances mcdormand age also married another professor 
okay maybe chivalrous 
 great line film spoken douglas sara says junkie printed word 
lucky manufactured drug choice 
robert downy j r plays bisexual editor makes entrance towering transvestite arm 
downy mastered gleefully dry hyper articulate wit many hipster intellectual 
hes arrogant completely likeable utter arrogance 
 actor perfectly cast remains joyous movie presence somewhere typical tom hanksian comic leading man edgy character actor 
 wish wonder boys 
searching plot among elements wonder boys pointless meanders running time thats part charm 
 maybe im bit biased towards film takes place haven literary academia place im greatly fond place rarely explored american cinema 
everyone subgenre war films westerns dance movies happen privy 
im privy films literary types e 
 individuals enthralled written word inclined may wise knock grade half notch 
 direction curtis hanson akin european film leisurely pace situations grow characters rather generic mapped story points 
sometimes dialogue clever thats problem wish found films often 
another minor quibble early film seems bit introverted like characters story progresses begins open 
 wonder boys works subtle drama insight artistic types lowkey comedy chuckleworthy throwaway gags 
 gags like great robert altman m s h long goodbye movies jokes exist asides fringes like jokes life often 
 broader comedy killing blind dog incessant smoking marijuana isnt ineffective nearly memorable little things 
curtis hanson last film la confidential toiled exploitation fare like losin early tom cruise sex comedy hand rocks cradle graduated meaningful films 
 directs wonder boys appropriately dour style comedy coming false gloom characters put 
 morose crooning leonard cohen seem odd song background party wonder boys party fits 
 film like piece literature put big screen 
 cinematic equivalent good read novelistic approach themes rarely found american movies 
many will find slight found much savor among subtleties
