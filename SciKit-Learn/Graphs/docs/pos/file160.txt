 last two films shine snow falling cedars australian director scott hicks proven cinematic flashbacks best latest hearts atlantis different 
 structure beginning ending present day one long flashback middle similar green mile bit ironic considering based stephen king books 
 parallels dont end either 
atlantis adapted william goldman previously penned bigscreen version misery process working script kings dreamcatcher 
even films content bit reminiscent mile 
 fact perfect blend feelgood s nostalgia stand also king mystical power hokum mile 
kings atlantis book comprised five related short stories main focus first longest tale called low men yellow coats films title comes second chapter 
 set harwich connecticut yearold bobby garfield anton yelchin lives boarding house run cold selfcentered mother elizabeth hope davis joe goulds secret seems care wardrobe son 
bobby spends time two closest friends john sullivan will rothhaar tomboy carol gerber mika boorem become something like kevin paul winnie harwich 
 new tenant moves vacant room fatherless bobby finds male role model ted brautigan anthony hopkins hannibal mysterious stranger vague enough past make bobbys mom suspicious enough least momentarily turn head away mirror 
ted teaches young neighbor wonders literature cheapskate mother gives library card birthday dispenses prophetic words wisdom even pays bobby one dollar week read local newspaper keep eyes peeled low men group people chasing ted exploit special powers 
 wont go powers theyre considerably toned book dont involve black stuff flying teds mouth la mile 
atlantis presentday setting bookends film based novels final chapter titled heavenly shades night falling features david morse yet another connection green mile married middleaged bobby learns death childhood friends returns dilapidated boarding house spent formative years 
atlantis nowhere near flashy hicks cedars disappointing understandable considering switch completely amazing robert richardson occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski oscarnominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowskis red 
 acting solid everyone including hopkins never makes think dr lecter 
 impressive youngsters yelchin boorem tiny parts along came spider 
 didnt really much problem goldmans screenplay need point least one inconsistency 
goldman dont read premiere writes seems like annual criticism everybody elses films carefully explaining suck make sense insult audiences somehow failing mention crap hes penned like generals daughter 
 meanspirited fun read mostly account nobody else hollywood balls say anything remotely negative anybody else business including michael jackson o j 
 robert blake 
 atlantis supposed told eyes young bobby one assume scene order memory flash back 
well hes doesnt make sense 
 pg violence thematic elements
