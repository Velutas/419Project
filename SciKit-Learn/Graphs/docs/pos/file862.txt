 indian runner courier 
 became message carrying 
 danger bear message 
 used think sean penn immature arrogant photographer punching madonnamarrying loudmouth 
 changed now 
 guy grown 
 thats 
 seems sean penn talents writer director film indication 
one might imagine movie plenty ruthless rage showy machismo given penn charge bronson hopper 
 
 film real struggle victories defeats simple 
penn lets story unfold pace dictated lives characters without unnecessary rush flash 
 focus story two brothers 
david morse brother grown small midwestern town raised tending failing farm finally becoming police officer 
viggo mortensen wild brother whose wild behavior seems reaction ancient pain cant name much less resolve 
 film picks story day mortensen returns vietnam morse coincidentally encounters armed youth fleeing state line 
 becomes clear kind conflict threatens link brothers shared 
 film unobtrusive simple direct plain sincere 
 isnt exactly perfect sincerity well invested struggle two brothers identify sickness destroys 
life seems move forward little faster can get handle problems 
 good film without big budget sets big name stars pushed face 
 fact im reviewing suspect may get much marketing 
 perhaps others showing saw 
 thought structure clean oversimplified though freeform sections also work well 
 obligatory s music seemed little cliche going dothis movie take place s 
 opinion worth fullprice admission
