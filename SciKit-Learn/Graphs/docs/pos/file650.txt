 promotion fear loathing las vegas made film comedy first hour seems like might one 
 hippie movement left behind quite washouts among journalist raoul duke johnny depp attorney dr gonzo benito del toro 
 two spend film druginduced stupor strange hallucinations trashing hotel rooms either annoying scaring almost everyone crosses path 
duke first assigned cover outdoor desert motorcycle race las vegas gets lost blur drugs beer flying dust ends wandering around clue won 
 leaves vegas briefly sent back can described strangely appropriate twist fate cover drug enforcement conference 
fear loathing misinterpreted glorifying use drugs 
 doesnt even beginningwhile pairs antics sometimes amusing relatively harmless first humor still fairly dark 
director terry gilliam views rather satirical eye even laughing laughing rather 
 spend time paranoid angry just plain befuddled probably understandable reaction seeing entire room suddenly fill giant reptiles 
 black comedy may entertaining watch onscreen probably something audience members want experience firsthand 
 aside starting grow bit restless film drew near onehour mark thinking wanted something just offkilter satire drug culture 
thankfully script delivers long duke rare moment lucidity stops recall enthusiastic hippie riding wave something seemed special important 
now six years later wave finally broken puts 
materialistic culture still alive well film right face las vegas american dream duke occasionally speaks still just shallow phony ever 
 social protesters lost questionable aspects movement turned ugly left casualties duke drift sea drugs disillusionment 
 many ways fear loathing gilliams realitybased film others exception fisher king made use sort fantasy sciencefiction plot elements 
yet offthewall masterpiece brazil film bears visual resemblance 
 protagonist brazil found alternately surrounded plastic soulless society constant chaos totalitarian police inspections terrorist attacks similarly dukes world composed artificial empty glam las vegas bizarre anarchy drug hallucinations 
unlike protagonist brazil however duke particularly admirable figure neither gonzo 
 latter half film trips turn nastier consequences worse eventually building incident diner gonzo crudely frightens humiliates waitress duke though doesnt seem approve doesnt anything stop either 
 time scene takes place dont seem like hippies peaceniks protesters anything sort just seem like couple stoned jerks diner 
duke seems realize level hes become something doesnt like hes either apathetic defeated anything change 
 film taken critical drubbing many view essentially pointless film simply throws one trip scene another audience 
 gilliam may overdone places think cowriters deserve credit 
theres plenty substance particularly second half observations broken defeated rebels s objects rebellion just arent usually pleasant 
unlike say brazil fisher king feature character dares let dream repressive environment fear loathing las vegas shows us someone whos given dreams resorts quick fix drugs 
 psychedelic whackedout way sad regretful think also bit kick pants challenge find alternative chemicallyinduced withdrawal equally addictive drug vegasstyle materialism 
indeed duke admits one point hes never learned accept can get higher without drugs 
im sure hes closer accepting end suspect audience will get idea
