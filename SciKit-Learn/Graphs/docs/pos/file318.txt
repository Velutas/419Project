john cusack kind actor seems effortlessly slide respective film roles 
 effortlessly people tend forget hes much way people rarely recall many great character actors anyone can put name james rebhorn actors face invited treat product one sponsors 
example day mother asked expert course movies worth seeing never mind tastes couldnt divergent ill never forget day recommended go see night roxbury god sakes fair mightily pissed telling go 
 lot fun didnt see anything futile attempt conversation 
 muttered little trepidation might enjoy high fidelity 
 responded usual query whose one 
 question whose answer seems immediately conjure kind movie went see 
 reply julia roberts probably assume something wispy light sylvester stallone movie picture bloodbath words much involuntary bicep flexing woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually jewish faith fretting upper east side palace 
anyway answered john cusack replied rather stunned unreasonable know referring 
now know fact mother seen several cusack movies recently john malkovich pushing tin suppose understandable recognize name names tougher faces 
 showed picture cusacks mug paper hoping oh yes hes quite good instead got dont know 
 point way beyond frustration realm nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance takes get nose hair pulling zone till realized something doubt much america recognize cusacks relatively bland visage even name rather bland compared coolness brad pitt tom cruise onesyllable names glide tongue velocity speeding car 
cusack cusack quite cool 
im sure twenty years now cusack will forever referred guy add cusack film choice 
hes brand name movies usually arent big moneymakers unassuming way hes kind genius 
 pleasant common man looks charming semiarticulate blatherings become one likeable romantic leading men s 
 sure thing say anything cusack merged talents early tom hanks early jack lemmon 
despite fact nearly every character plays variation character schlumpy every man hes constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks woody allen 
 knows chose scripts stephan baldwins val kilmers seem put selves everything former actually insight follow oscar winner usual suspects pauly shore vehicle judging latest projects looks like still yet fire agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save unwatchable hot pursuit film also featuring young ben stiller 
high fidelity second collaboration hit miss english director stephan fears grifters hilo country hit 
 also cowritten cusack collaborators terrific comedy grosse point blank 
 quite entertaining funny film progresses meandering fashion movie cast something spell 
high fidelity begins hipster ode noncommittal rob vinyl record store owner opens film breaking fourth wall much abandon educating us top break ups list 
 something cusack entire film la ferris buellers day 
 first talkingdirectlyintothecameraschtick vaguely annoyed mostly reminded much film body shots used similar conceit began grow due almost entirely cusacks witty delivery 
hes kind guy dont mind talking directly us 
gradually film settles shampoolike tragicomic character study guy must confront personal failures order figure true person yes existential 
though plotline mostly enjoyable thing liked film much pleasure offers introducing us minor characters now really something terrific enough warrant films 
 best jack black funny show tenacious d program sadly went way bruce willis hair unfortunately annoying smirk remains ardent record store employee bullies customers buying exactly wants buy 
hes kind guy im sure weve met blowhard thinks hes always right will anything power yell argue insult hoist opinion onto others 
 like guy black plays 
 actor portly round baby face crazy eyes despite size leaps fro like manic speed freak might bit redundant description seeing speed freaks know manic 
hes kind supporting character impossibly annoying comic relief films 
 look hack jan de bont poor phillip seymour hoffman twister 
 fears black never let happen 
 character shucking jiving steeped reality 
hes top way can probably relate 
catherine zetajones brief role gives vivid portrayal women completely enamored charm 
tim robbins registers even tinier part new agetype character played entirely cartoon yuks still manages work desired comic effect 
 one exception acting department bit doozy main love interest played danish actress iben hjejle mifune completely obliterates trace danish accent replacing stilted american phonation 
 give kudos attempting contradictory role instead likeable comes across rather robotic hard see cusacks character obsessed especially beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting wings 
 reminded say anything charming cusack paired charmless ione skye midnight garden good evil poor bastard put alison eastwood whose unbelievably wooden father clint special people whose wheels turn little slower 
 fact cusack rarely paired personality matches though id bet laura natasha switched roles result effective 
high fidelity works almost entirely strength characters performances 
fears direction somewhat stilted script sometimes little word im beginning hate use alas must quirky good think ill blame scott rosenberg judging beautiful girls con air things denver dead fingerprints irritating bits movie 
 cusack really deserve award damn cusackian 
im afraid talents understated may wait till hip needs replacing offered award worthy considerable talent 
 character rob whose sort like older bitter lloyd say anything funny tragic without pathetic cusack can still imprint onto minds audiences something achievement
