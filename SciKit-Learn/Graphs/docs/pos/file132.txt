 read novel thomas hardy jude obscure final novel final film created outrage never wrote see research man plagued bad luck throughout entire life 
 watching movie can imagine incredibly depressing 
 jude satirical film start finish societys way spitting chewing unwanted system whats remarkable timeless film 
 film takes place late th century early th wasnt really sure story even retold today modern form although itd kinda different given 
 tells story jude christopher eccleston psychotic accountant shallow grave simple dimwitted young man big dreams 
 bleak foreboding opening shot grainy black white gets lesson phillotson liam cunningham teacher stand upon mountain looking upon city distance says work hard can anything world 
 marrying divorcing immature woman named arabella rachel griffiths frolicked hay literally ultimately share anything common moves away town giant university chance learn get ahead life 
taking welding job works hard studying constantly college bars reciting latin training 
 sends application school bluntly told just remain worker 
another reason going town someone family lives sue kate winslet cousin intelligent kinda mischevious young woman wants school teacher 
 jude click eventually become endearing friends much spends night flat running apprentice teacher job none phillotson local school rumors jude nasty business nudge nudge 
several twists turn storyline eventually jude sue nasty business interesting scene say least soon born controversial nonwedlock eventually gives birth baby jude inherits son arabella turns awhile 
 arent married theyre cousins run problems every place go carrying around two children everywhere staying lodges brief period time moving 
 didnt think harsh enough wait till see happens later 
 sad truth jude one miserable people can never get luck world 
 will never gain true happiness happiness happens will fleeting will probably bring horrible instances life 
part fault hes optimistic gullible 
 society way taking people hurting death 
 ending jude bleak although hear ending novel even worse guess ill read now 
 jude offers satirical view societys cruelties shows way curing thank heavens doesnt 
theres way relinquish selfishness society solution small cure mass problem 
satire always one ways changing certain peoples minds thats jude 
sure one hell downer needs 
 film also posesses two fantastic performances two leads good supporting work along 
christopher eccleston slightly resembling richard edson new look dumb expression plays jude wonderfully sometimes bringing big dumb smile face making kind childlike times 
kate winslet pre titanic performance brilliant nailing every psyche character creating someone whos troubled seductive personality 
kate may best actress age group dont believe see titanic branaghs hamlet sense sensibility heavenly creatures latter one favorite performance 
 supporting roles liam cunningham wonderfully flawed teacher exposing bad parts ultimately pretty good person rachel griffiths wonderfully immature judes wife never divorces 
 jude moves slow pace keeps taunting viewers chances happiness protagonists drive people nuts 
 appreciate good social commentary films matter slow downright depressing one will appreciate jude though doubt anyone truly enjoys
