whether meddling studio executives work writerdirector james cameron original cut underwater scifi thriller entertaining enough also quite seriously flawed 
 main problem fairly simple films climax unworthy buildup 
someone th century fox doubt cameron must agreed came theatrical release abyss special edition 
now available video seems timely reevaluate newly revamped state now nearmasterpiece despite borrowings films like odyssey two alien close encounters third kind 
 plot thus

 earth left original 
 reviewer finds utterly incomprehensible 
 minutes additional footage thats turned decent underwater thriller something quite magnificent 
 say quite flaws remain 
 grating several moments corny hollywood schmaltz new old may well reaching barf bag 
nonetheless abyss special edition now stands somewhat maligned film among james camerons greatest achievements alongside aliens terminator see moved gripped spellbound
