despite obligatory cop movie scenes every copnew partner movie start way 
 sgt 
assigns roper partner roper confronts sarge etc film still one heck explosive ride 
 scene involving cable car seen believed boasts amazing car stunts 
eddie murphy shines tailormade role character shows depth concern 
 confronting joe prison can feel anger drip every word 
michael rappaport basically throwaway 
 serves purpose except buddy murphy get disabled final reel eddie can save day 
typical action escapist fare 
michael wincott offers best performance crazed killer jewel thief joe 
never seen villian written like actually believe serious take seriously
