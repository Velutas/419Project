 respects rush hour ultimate exercise cliched filmmaking 
 hero renegade cop prefers work alone 
 cop question solve case gets trouble 
 chinese people somehow involved criminal element 
 duo must always completely mismatched 
 hero say smartassed comment shooting someone 
however doesnt necessarily make bad film 
rush hour jackie chans first major hollywood film since dismal protector 
proving hollywood can learn many things foreign film markets ie hong kong jackie chan given much free reign 
still diehard jackie chan fans may disappointed even chan voiced displeasure length fight scenes views short according one interview 
 film takes familiar theme east meets west 
jackie chan lee straight laced inspector imported help deal kidnapping case chris tucker carter loudmouthed destructive cop promoted fbi help 
 least thinks also another classic notion action films fbi must always get way heroes 
despite necessary conventions action films rush hour fun youll spend hour forty minutes watching 
jackie chan continues one exciting martial artists big screen continuing perform stunts dazzling audiences flashy kicks punches 
chris tucker familiar whiny annoying role fifth element palatable complementing jackie chans straightlaced character 
however jackie chan still maintains comicslapstick edge expected films 
perfectly downplaying fishoutofwater routine characters attempts mixing american culture makes time character experiences 
 action however youll amused dazzled 
still inventive use objects beat people case steering wheel serving tray barstool jackie chan proves pioneer slapstick kung fu 
chris tuckers character may come across irritating yet also humorous 
since hes physical actor level jackie chan uses main weapon mouth hence tagline fastest hands east meets fastest mouth west 
 dialogue necessarily shakespeare appropriate film still funny 
 necessarily poignant attempts character development growth characters come surprisingly well 
lees knowledge american pop culture thats beach boys 
 contrasted carters lack knowledge chinese culture makes interesting scene lee teaches carter kung fu disarming trick carter teaches lee hiphop dance moves 
 rush hour level police story known north america supercop jackie chans first strike respectively makes poorly received films operation condor mr nice guy 
 appropriate mixture high kicks lots laughs makes fun film 
 well true departure jackie chan films missing one common element whiny female costar
