 psycho meets exorcist holds barred 
 blurb like sounds like desperate publicity low budget third rate ripoff 
 tacky plug comes poster suspiria perhaps italian horror director dario argentos consistently successful film 
 impresses rewatching surrealistic supernatural thriller argentos directorial flair stylish visuals matched nearfully coherent narrative 
screenplays always achilles heel confusing subplots gaping holes totally illogical incidents reactions 
 question argento always better director writer 
fortunately gets plotting pretty well right suspiria taking cue book thomas de quincey called suspiria de profundis 
 films storyline suffers major lapses logic provided one can accept premise ballet school front coven witches 
jessica harper plays american travels germany studies dance 
arriving school late night driving rain sees girl leave run storm clearly distressed state 
 happens next dont make comparison lightly murder sequence intensity shock value sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcocks infamous shower scene psycho 
 quite possibly homage hitchcock baroque sets graphic gore brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment gothic rock group goblin stunning sequence remains much argentos 
though nothing else quite equals intensity suspirias opening minutes film continues never anything less engrossing harper begins investigations slowly comes realise ordinary ballet school 
 meet assortment slightly sinister characters notably head ballet teacher played alida valli another one delicious souroldmatriarchfromhell roles well 
several violent murders ensue including startling scene deserted square blind man well wouldnt want spoil things now films climax staged amid secret corridors hidden rooms gothic ghoulishness thats impressive 
 english language versions argento movies usually suffer trimming just violence deep red phenomena example appallingly hacked 
fortunately cuts suspiria minutes version adversely affected film 
 dubbing italian actors english quite competently done excepting one appalling unintentionally hilarious effort conversation harper professor history witchcraft region 
 soundtrack 
 interesting imagine power film lost scored someone else 
 stands use goblins music suspiria outstanding 
apparently argento played soundtrack location filming actors hear music acted parts 
 stereo video player adds greatly viewers overall experience 
even better see suspiria cinema youll get added bonus widescreen 
 colours 
deep reds eerie blues superb use shadow contrast 
 cinematography luciano tovoli whose recent credits include reversal fortune single white female uniformly superb 
 nod also must go production designer giuseppe bassan wonderful baroque interiors 
 kinds settings crucial atmosphere argentos surreal excursions notable example inferno bassan also worked 
suspiria film broke dario argento major league european directors fully deserving cult status 
 gore times little excessive overstated thats always one argentos shortcomings overall fascinating compelling example italian horror
