plot young man loves heavy metal music especially band steel dragon hes devoted tribute band sings gets launched stardom real group get rid lead singer call take place 
critique im sucker movies like 
 young man humble background lofty dreams works hard devotes time energy patience ultimately hits bigtime 
 case film boy loves certain heavy metal band luck yup luck always finds way types equations although generally tied closely hard work need new singer 
 entry adaptation whole rock n roll lifestyle fills rest film really fun watch 
although will preface saying one thing definitely enhance appreciation film love past love heavy metal music whole scene around 
metal one first loves teen even though genre music isnt prominent anymore still check motley crue twisted sister anthrax cds every now 
thats say wont like film dont like music music live performances band play big part movie one blast watching listening 
 even greater draw film standout performance given mark wahlberg 
wow hand fella major props totally becomes heavy metal geekgod incidentally metal god films original title much better one ask 
 movie quite taken character pretty much whole way 
 came like regular guy extremely passionate goals work ethic willing anything order fulfill dreams 
aniston also surprisingly good girlfriend romance angle sweet didnt pull hard enough emotional scenes 
 also impressed real musicians played film zakk wylde ozzy osbourne jeff pilson dokken stephan jenkins third eye blind blas elias slaughter actor dominic west kirk cuddy made biggest impression among band members 
 note film based reallife tale young man used sing judas priest cover band went become actual singer original singer also admitted gay film 
just record im certainly recommending film originality surprise elements since stuff already covered way another movies fun uplifting wellpaced movie solid central showing wahlberg energetic live performances
