 earned r rating reason 
 plenty nudity sex violence gore gore violence sex nudity 
 film really isnt subtle anything showing us everything 
 actually surprises film receive nc rating quite harsh 
however movie merits nudity sex among 
 dont condone sex nudity films might well enjoy 
 biggest merit film also interesting watch

portrayed extremely effective charlize theron mary anns problems incredibly intense found wanting witness decline 
 may sound uncaring wanted watch felt sorry 
 interesting character screen forced world wanted 
something devils advocate contained actually shocked reasons extreme violence nudity especially film nature 
 story actually something say humanity 
 one last scenes john milton explains kevin lomax game god plays children satan course 
 comments human nature lust loathe vanity 
 god sets rules contradict human nature 
 semireligious bashing humorous frightening 
 milton says true society found laughing loud partially thinking funny patially realizing true 
 moral dilemmas present throughout devils advocate giving added depth many films skip writing im sure came straight novel based 
 film something say society deserves watched 
 cast devils advocate one highlights see memorable faces put spins memorable faces dont expect 
heather matarazzo makes brief appearance terrorized victim opening court case great job 
probably big surprise film keanu reeves 
 proven uneven actor successes speed bombs johnny mnemonic tops performance 
 never seen believable date 
al pacino course scene stealer 
 devilish performance equal jack nicholson witches eastwick max von sydow needful things 
 easily gone far top many scenes remains completely believable correct term 
jeffrey jones mostly known principal ferris buellers day also gives good performance eddie barzoon 
judith ivey manages credible performance mother holds secret kevins past 
connie nielson effective role also appears naked several times 
one familiar face twist coach star craig t nelson gives good performance 
 devils advocate rated r sexuality nudity violence language gore 
 minutes film moves along fairly quickly 
 first two hours sat completely engaged good performances strong characters 
 technical quality also remarkable great special effects good musical score 
director taylor hackford managed create disturbing motion picture ruin good chunk tension final fifteen minutes 
 guess biggest problem ending fact went theater expecting disturbing film hackford gave just long time 
 just end got jitterish relied hollywood safety net order make film mainstream 
personally preferred ending fifteen minutes early
