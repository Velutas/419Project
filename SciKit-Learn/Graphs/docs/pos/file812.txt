 take play carnegie hall 
practice 
 takes two hours music heart play carnegie hall figuratively literally 
like children portrays movie starts dark realms awful cinema works way showstopping performance legendary concert hall 
roberta guaspari academy award winner meryl streep two kids husband left violins bought small shop mediterranean 
 life desperately needs jump start gets one meets man introduces job music teacher east harlem elementary school 
 soon finds job rocks men life continue rotate revolving doors 
 patternlike plot production 
ultimately film chooses zerosum answer problems finds music career alltime high men life finally vanish 
 first hour music heart rather painful 
robertas character lacks development consequently seems flat 
also lacking depth films bad guy narrowminded music teacher josh pais rejects roberta principle movie never explains exactly principle conveniently comes goes plot according might dramatic villain around 
 next minutes film mediocre 
 highlighted one childs return robertas class coming great old hollywood scene explains cant around anymore mom said glowing concert 
 knowing running time may expect credits role point 
 dont 
instead film uses next minutes finish journey bad mediocre excellent 
director wes craven known works horror uses old sentimental tricks get audience tearing 
one romantic break scene highlighted classic 
last night 
 robertas two children also textbook conflicts single mother regarding fathers absence 
 city harlem plays strong role movie 
robertas mother initially reluctant see daughter move part town film nothing combat stereotype 
 noise tracks scenes dominated sirens predictably one robertas students gunned killed screen 
one thing film lack subtlety 
 fact little boy playing shall overcome violin aforementioned shooting cute discreet reference 
 fact entire orchestra begins play soon overdone reference shows little credit gives audience 
 course horror films foreshadowing betweentheline moments meant overdone perhaps just learning play game 
even flaws music heart beautiful film 
 excuse movies poor beginning 
 watched scenes carnegie hall thought great acts taken stage 
 december comedian named andy kaufman put show will forever remembered one original theatre history 
 performance included deadon elvis impression robin williams disguise moment end kaufman announced take whole audience milk cookies 
 comic genius choose open show life 
 character named tony clifton take stage sole purpose irritating angering audience 
perhaps okay music heart start rusty just kaufman santas favorite food movie amazing finale
