anastasia contains something lacking recent disney releases 
 especially hercules 
emotion 
 wacky characters voiced celebrities fantastically animated adventure sequences arent going hold anyones interest unless emotional core hold together 
 since disneys beauty beast compelling animated film interesting characters drama works 
 story romanov family rulers russia downfall begins film 
anastasia one daughters narrowly escapes mad monk rasputin voiced christopher lloyd grandmother voiced angela landsbury 
 anastasia gets lost grows memory royal origins 
 grandmother lives paris hoping someday find beloved anastasia member family survive russian revolution 
 young woman named anya voiced meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack vlad kelsey grammar trying put together scheme create anastasia fool grandmother get reward money 
 pick anya pose princes course soon revealed anya fact lost anastasia 
dimitri realizes can never win love commoner meanwhile rasputin dead plots revenge last romanov 
 plot actually quite well structured 
 lot complexities may explained kids later moves along fast enough theyll never time bored 
 really means adults wont bored either 
 great deal banter anya dimitri funny relationship develops quite naturally film progresses 
 course lots comedy kids including rasputins pet bat bartok hank azaria easily funniest thing film 
however comical scenes never distract drama worked plot almost seamlessly 
 animation gorgeous characters seem come life talented animators 
 since beauty beast animated characters much life 
even without voices act 
 musical number paris showstopper backgrounds rendered impressionist painting style 
 recent animated features songs however songs just provide fodder top singers get radio although three end credits 
 songs catchy advance plot instead just showpieces except paris number thats much fun okay 
 cant reccomend anastasia highly enough 
 wonderful film ranks right animated classics 
kids adults alike will enjoy also nice quality animated feature film another studio besides disney
