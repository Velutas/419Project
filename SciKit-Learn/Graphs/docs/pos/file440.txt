 hearing reviews woody allens upteenth movie history celebrity range terribly boring just soso heart lept opening images film closely resembled manhattan personal favorite personal favorite director time 
woody allens films almost never rely visual flair textual flair one films closely resembles one time two entities fit handinhand manhattan really one bestlooking films ive ever seen beautiful black white photography citys best areas etc fan cant help feel visibly moved 
 film opens usual credits plain white font black backgrounds old ironic standard playing soundtrack screen fills gorgeous dull gray sky word help spelled airplane 
beethovens th blasts soundtrack 
 city seems stop take notice moment rather lovely look 
 cut film crew shooting films hilariously banal key moment film lead actress film melanie griffith looking buxom beautiful ever realize somethings wrong life whatever 
 terribly stale scene woody allen film great opening shots without heart sank soon got used fact new film going great past works though record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close 
 hell happened 
 man relied neurotic freshness cinema become less funny films become less insightful like tossed together unfinished ideas 
 bullets broadway though wonderful relies irony pull farce just never totally takes 
 mighty aphrodite full great moments lines really great story 
 everyone says love great idea great film 
even deconstructing harry admittingly cheap way even top one truly hilarious films 
 anything reception celebrity everyone tip allen fact time audience critics wrong wonderful film 
 celebrity yes good film marginally satisfying woody allen film 
instead creating great woody allen world hes created world subject knows bit 
 hes fashioned film based almost entirely uninformed philosophy celebrities plays like series skits minor connections 
 like la dolce vita without accuracy right amount wit correct personal crisis 
woody becoming insecure old age choses drop woody allen character world celebrities hang flaws scrutiny casting brit actor kenneth branagh lead 
much said performance dead irritating makes one yearn real thing blah blah blah anyone actually knows woody allen character knows branaghs performance though featuring mannerisms stuttering whining lots o hand gestures hardly wartsandall impersonation 
branagh brings along little woody allen charm actually allows characters flaws apparent 
woodys flawed guy know love anyway hes really funny really witty really intelligent 
branaghs allen bit flatout bad charm yes like still sure hes really good person 
 character lee simon first seen set aforementioned movie hits extra actress winona ryder goes interview griffith takes childhood home makes pass denies sorta 
 learn flashbacks lee sucked trying celebrity thanks midlife crisis appearance high school reunion 
 since quit job travel journalist become gossip journalist sorts covering movie sets places celebrities congregate can meet maybe sell script bank robbery movie deep personal crisis 
 divorced wife several years allen regular judy davis continues quest sexual happiness boucing girlfriend girlfriend fling fling course film 
 griffith comes escapades model charlize theron polymorphously perverse glad see allen using new jokes ha ha takes wild ride different anita ekberg segment la dolce vita 
following safe relationship smart working woman famke janssen relationship almost assures success continued escapades ryder fancies 
 story juxtaposed davis flips stumbles onto happiness runs handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna lands job furthers career national status 
 lee fumbling selfishly trying ensure happiness davis becomes happy ive become kind woman ive always hated 
im loving 
without thing 
 result film highs mediums 
 mediums take film sitations scenes dont exactly work cant help pat allen back trying 
 places really great scenes 
 opening 
 sequence theron good wished hadnt ended 
 banana scene bebe neuwirth droll ever 
 perhaps best sequence romp hotashell teen idol brandon darrow played none leo dicaprio undicaprioesque fans sit film theyd never look way 
 ignites screen intensity spares nothing showing character narcissistically tyrannical totally heartbreaking lee comes talk script read finds wild allday ride 
 go atlantic city watch fight gamble wind hotel room darrow gets flame gretchen mol lends one leftover groupies 
allens writing scenes good just id almost recommend film 
almost 
 really liked film despite fact mess despite fact film really needs good old fashioned rewrite allen still smart insightful film 
though jokes either stale misplaced seem cartoonish even environment allen still manages get across film exactly celebrities may seem itd extremely outoftouch want celebrities equate celebrityhood happiness 
 never get close enough actual celebrities see theyre really happy may appear surface get close enough lee davis character 
lee obsessed phenomenon davis takes arms length never gets involved soon becomes one 
besides witty one thing film allens great woody allen feel 
 may exactly fresh lively totally brilliant depiction subject yes part woody allens oeuvre merely blip annie hall shadows fog either goes prove one can make film like maybe godard possibly take totally horrible metaphor like one beginning make work twice
