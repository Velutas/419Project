luckily people got starship troopers 
 people knew supposed silly 
 didnt miss 
 beginning see interactive internetlike promotional video armed forces future obvious film taken lightly 
 guess without blatant oneliners home alone style slapstick people just dont recognize goofy humor 
 dry approach intentionally campy humor must left disillusioned 
first thing seeing movie lighten 
meet equivalent beverly hills meets mighty morphin power rangers 
four close friends now graduating high school ready join armed forces future means fighting whole galaxy just country 
johnny rico casper van dien ready join infantry mostly girlfriend carmen ibanez denise richards enlisted pilot 
dizzy flores dina meyer enlisted trooper possible shes joining merely follow rico shes always eyes 
 saw three street youd automatically start searching fashion designers photographers never movies cast looked much like cutout cover seventeen magazine

 sudden change heart clothes rico back game following fellow starship troopers fight mean group daddy long legs 
 starship troopers really spoof even remotely touches soap opera like love affairs high school love scifi thirst gore shared age group etc nothing taken seriously 
 almost much satire young adults clueless sly futuristic approach recognizably 
 spoof subtle many wont recognize spoofery 
 deem scifiaction youre wrong 
 scifiactioncomedy comedy level cult favorites evil dead starship troopers just may road cult status well 
gore factor heavily brought reviews film gore meant cheesy 
yes graphic also brutally phony thats makes great fun watch 
 since old mr bill skits saturday night live torture mutilation joy watch 
people laughing loud every time body severed half head viciously decapitated 
perhaps brings back fond memories severities inflicted upon sisters barbie dolls young children 
 actors resembling ken barbie closely good chance case whether fully aware 
starship troopers slow parts truly alternative typical scifiaction flick lame juvenile comedy 
aside intentionally cheesy gore special effects quite astounding 
 spaceship passes meteor quite awesome spectacle visually crisp captivating 
 youre looking brainless fun epitome search 
 beautiful cast awesome special effects fastpaced action campy acting whole lot gore 
 brainless heaven
