 read review gotta know love woody allen 
 important note allens films generally acquired taste definitely everyone 
 know folks believe complete genius others see dirty ol schnook keeps making movie 
 love films will admit quite disappointed recent crop s 
 fact felt need make movies years beyond 
 look quality films youll hear im saying 
 two films really liked time bullets broadway husbands wives 
 fact secretly hoped take time turn millennium just reenergize something doesnt appear though intention 
 reviewing yet another woody allen movie hoping brings back woody days old 
plot year woody allen topnotch insurance investigator 
 methods oldfashioned apparently date 
 new employee hunt just hired streamline operations greater efficiency 
 two like 
one night put hypnotic trance magician unbeknownst placed control 
soon thereafter jewels stolen words love exchanged everyone looking answer 
critique wonderful recreation s style movies fasttalking witty banter coworkers catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements veronica laketype sexpot oneliners galore fluffy inconsequential plotline 
 downside film actually starts pretty slowly first hour tossing guffaws never really generating kind steady flow energy 
 sets hand amazing production design costumes perfect casting ideal kept hoping film pick turn yet another mediocre outing man 
 wasnt long fully engaged characters entertained many zingers delivered backandforth allen hunt actually interested resolution flick 
 also appreciated allen played fine line homage films old parody actual reinvention note therons entire female persona drenched film noir cool 
 course films like little real tension plot need solid actors keep interested quickfire dialogue allen great job playing character isnt typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude 
 actually plays macho guy handles pretty well especially scenes hes hypnotized 
 bigger surprise film helen hunt actress openly sick seeing movies late last year sorry babe just many time 
anyway shes really great film headstrong woman looking new era equality amongst men doesnt miss beat allens fastpaced dialogue 
 didnt care much running joke dying whenever left room overall really good especially liked way sweaters clung breasts yum 
yum 
harumph digress 
 lets recap 
 great looking picture nice jazzy score funny oneliners especially second half decent plotline although shouldnt expect real mystery anything solid acting around 
 cant say even remotely close allens best work certainly believe step right direction especially dinky decade films just went 
 probably better geared towards allen fans anyone else still recommend film anyone looking cute oldschool kind vibe chemistry leads zippy dialogue satisfying conclusion 
little known facts film stars annie hall celebrity everyone says love husbands wives mighty aphrodite small time crooks harry met sally youve got mail
