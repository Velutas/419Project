 black white new film writerdirector james toback eventually remembered one thing will revelation brooke shields claudia schiffer marla maples mike tyson can act 
however partly improvised gem will remembered 
black white fascinating film makes statement americas youth hiphop culture without getting heavyhanded overly serious 
featuring cast known commodities ben stiller robert downey jr hot newcomers singers bijou phillips tobacks complex film worth seeing 
black white multiple storylines related la robert altman

mike tyson 
 stories ebb flow film losing gaining prominence time 
friendships lost lovers gained occasional burst violence 
originally rated nc united states black white features lot sex black gangstas young white girls 
 film trimmed tamer r rating viewers will wonder explicit seeing 
 threeway sexual beginning film nicely warns viewers several audience members got left point 
 frequent sex one films flaws titillation overdone times completely unrelated anything else going film 
 tobacks credit level violence black white almost nil 
 gangstas hiphop artists given real problems concerns become guntoting crazies benefits appear way 
whenever character finds donagers handheld digital camera starts spouting righteous tirades america proclaims independence everyone fully bought idea 
charlie phillips full bluster loves hiphop admits ten years time ill way 
 youth know going phase simply enjoying 
toback fills spaces tirades scenes lightweight funny 
 humour comes mike tyson provides films comic relief without really trying 
 given big words like vernacular say rich tries discuss particular street problem tyson frequently ask use smaller words explain better playing tysons image dimwit 
 tyson also gets films scariest moment 
 mercilessly hit upon gay terry tyson marvel watch fights remain calm 
 scene entirely improvised downey jr told just keep tyson gets reaction 
 reaction gets slapped choked astonishing downey jrs face turns frightening shade purple 
black white film hiphop culture films omnipresent hiphop soundtrack strongly supports 
 toback keeps things becoming serious moving story story quickly toback keeps us becoming attached one characters struggle 
thus black whites message hiphop becomes secondary film 
toback just wants us fun maybe learn little hiphop along way
