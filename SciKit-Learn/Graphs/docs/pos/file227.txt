 chance see sneak preview city slickers ii campus last night 
 went expectation film similar flavor made original success personal growth insightful humor life 
 came away somewhat disappointed regard getting latter much former 
 basic plot revolves around billy crystal plays mitch robbins turning forty 
hes now become station manager radio station worked original 
hes given job radio station best friend played daniel stern sympathy sterns character works divorce 
 loser younger brother john lovitz comes mitchs house bum money place live mitch wife try celebrate birthday 
 celebration mitch discovers appears treasure map curlys cattle drive leader original played jack palance old hat 
 business trip las vegas crystal stern lovitz stay extra days go search treasure 
 way run curlys twin brother duke played know jack palance 
first cinematography beautifully done especially outdoor scenes desert 
 scenes like see sights filmed 
 character development film 
 actors remain true characters play well without overplaying jokes 
 movie good basic adventure enough plot twists provide ending difficult predict 
 movie paced well couple slow spots middle towards end 
humorwise film good number jokes maintained interest throughout film 
 memorable moments like stern bitten snake fewer jokes laugh sequel surprise surprise sequel right 
however slight bitter aftertaste film mainly films manipulation audience 
 film tries pull heartstrings much regarding close characters like mitch decided suck snake marrow best friends butt 
 done gang meets members cattle drive group original 
 also parts appeared unrealistic like whether stampede start way didnt worry water tromping around desert 
 strenuous stretches imagination required 
since objective gang find gold get rich unlike finding middle age like original also found harder empathize characters journey 
overall id say film entertaining humorous adventure storyline deficiencies making less worthy original 
 may worth full price admission matinee better bargain
