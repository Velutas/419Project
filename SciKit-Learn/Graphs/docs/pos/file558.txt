 exception surrealistic satire barton fink films joel ethan coen fit two broad categories quirky sometimes darkly humorous takes film noir genre crime schemes go wrong spin increasingly control fargo millers crossing blood simple offthewall comedies centered around eccentric scatterbrained lead character raising arizona hudsucker proxy 
 latest offering big lebowski falls within latter category though elements crimegonewrong theme even touch satire found film 
 main difference however protagonists raising arizona hudsucker proxy lofty aspirations ideals didnt quite brains get together main character big lebowski seems like fairly intelligent guy whos wise world doesnt really want much anything besides go bowling smoke pot generally relax 
 main character jeffrey dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced films rambling narrator sam elliott quite possibly laziest man los angeles county 
 dude unemployed needless say spends time bowling alley two best friends walter john goodman borderlinepsychotic whos habit pulling gun thinks somebodys cheating bowling match whole world gone crazy shouts suspected cheater donny steve buscemi whos always steps behind conversation constantly berated walter donny frame reference 
 three seem less live bowling tournaments film begins anticipating important match rival bowler jesus quintana john turturro first meet dance bowling lane accompany spanish version hotel california possible seems even head case walter 
 doesnt give good idea films absurdist tone perhaps will entire scenario drives story set motion two thugs mistakenly urinating dudes rug 
theyve mistaken millionaire name also known big lebowski david huddleston whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara 
 dude goes big lebowski seeking compensation ruined rug doesnt luck bunny apparently kidnapped elder lebowski asks deliver million ransom 
unfortunately walter gets involved fouls dropoff can try get money supposed kidnappers dudes car gets stolen along briefcase containing money 
soon dude harassed big lebowski also treehorn group german nihilists demand ransom money even though may involved kidnapping first place dude walter suspect bunny may well kidnapped order extort money husband repay debts treehorn 
meanwhile big lebowskis daughter maude julianne moore feminist avantgarde artist likes make grand entrances swinging air naked wants recover money family 
 plot however really just vehicle bizarre characters run wild wreak unique forms havoc 
 previews big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revivals run jungle fits coens see los angeles veritable jungle oddballs nutcases sometimes bewildered dude left run try avoid trouble usually unsuccessfully 
 film doesnt feature quite many oneliners sight gags coens comedies though hilarious moments visual humor particularly dudes dream sequences acid flashbacks makes sheer fun watching strange characters interact 
 film sometimes seems little disjointed result get feeling coens set characters loose jungle also running crazy jungle twisted imaginations part characterizations interesting enough overcome shaky plotting turns somewhat anticlimactic resolution 
theres also noticeable heavyhanded thread social commentary big lebowski incidentally takes place just gulf war begin beginning see george bush television making aggression will stand speech 
 coens take aim just every elite l subculture book egotistical wealthy businessman bums will always lose 
shouts big lebowski one point porn industry overbearing malibu policeman berates dude disturbing peaceful beach community 
 end really start admire dude almost certainly harbors least aggression anyone story passive resistance emphasis passive albeit elite emerges something just another quirky characterization film overflowing quirky characters 
 also turns pretty wellfunctioning brain head even doesnt like use much sarcasm towards treehorn malibu policeman shows knows hes getting run around manage unravel kidnapping mystery end 
 coens certainly poke fun dude laziness dont just treat fodder cheap shots either 
 think anything makes big lebowski standout comedy manages approach characters like dude extent walter genuine affection still acknowledging pretty scatterbrained 
audience members may find surprised much like undynamic duo end movie given seemed like nothing butts extended joke first 
 good knowin hes dude takin easy posits narrator towards end 
 dare say truer words seldom spoken
