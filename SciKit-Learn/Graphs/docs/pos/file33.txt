 african american detective vergil tibbs questions suspected white murderer inside jail cell wonderful eyecatching shot instantaneously presents main message entire film 
 shot tibbs face completely covered shadows prison bars 
 see bars blocking face see separated tibbs rest characters film 
 black detective conducting investigation southern town full violent white bigots matter innocent tibbs still seen bigots threat simply color skin 
 bars show tibbs given fair chance show exactly instead others chosen different dangerous 
 one shot amazes captures whole theme matter seconds 
 perhaps may powerful image seen film 
 heat night first best three films norman jewison directed concerning racism america 
jewison keen style displaying various cases racism neither pedantic overly sentimental 
 three films excellent job creating detailed equal analyses characters abused abusers 
 also afraid tell absolute truth corrupt society past present 
preceding original soldiers story recently released hurricane heat night contains classic lines memorable characters 
 film won best picture focuses vergil tibbs played superbly sidney poitier fearless african american police officer philadelphia refuses give investigation white town wanted 
tibbs man rarely loses temper worth mentioning constantly facing abuse around 
 hero afraid face five men chains tibbs perfect protagonist 
poitier also gives excellent noteworthy voice character 
never nervous always commanding speech patterns manipulative range stentorian soothing 
however unlike hurricane denzel washington dominated rest cast poitier shares spotlight rod steiger won best actor excellent performance 
 sheriff helps tibbs warns dangers around steiger shows great amount skill role 
 starts racist blind townspeople 
 refer tibbs boy always suspiciously keep eye 
 film progresses though gradual change sheriff 
 begins see hardships tibbs faces sees foolishness neighbors 
 really enjoyed steigers character completely abandon friends connect tibbs end film 
 still refer tibbs mister tibbs officer tibbs rather settled virgil 
instead apparent eventually going see world differently future 
 movies character reversing beliefs influences matter minutes 
 action realistic since nearly impossible someone believe something one day believe something else next day 
jewisons determination make film realistic possible obvious also appropriate 
 heat night shows difference north south major city small town united states s 
 displays perfectly 
however actual investigation although main focus film lacks interest 
 seemed rushed especially towards end jewison given message racism feel like giving credible explanation involving murder victim 
 way many characters added last fifteen minutes scenes time period inane police officer sam suspect needed 
also given tibbs vigilant homicide detective best discoveries came nowhere found important case details towards end never answered 
 rushed ending mistake otherwise memorable jewison classic 
 congratulations given actor scott wilson 
 managed two best movies heat night even better cold blood
