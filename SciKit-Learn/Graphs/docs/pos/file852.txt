 hypnotized man believes ghost house 
 review 
two lowkey summer horror films become surprise financial successes year blair witch project sixth sense 
 made well million north america based combination strong word mouth clever advertising 
 films box office take based primarily quality stir echoes join blair sense grossing far money expected scary scarier two 
writerdirector david koepp given artisan entertainment folks distributed blair witch second creepy hit 
 story gets going tom witzky bacon average bluecollar dad gets hypnotized wife maggies erbe sister lisa douglas party 
 hypnosis goes expected partygoers triggers something toms head 
things begin change around blinking red lights let strange hum example fights stay control senses 
 experiences take tom maggie son jake cope tom thinks might answers dark path will scare disturb 
david koepp keeps action localized majority action takes place toms house just street 
 keeping things home koepp able proceed without resort clumsy segues montages driving roads move one city another etc 
unfortunately dread spookiness stir echoes frequently interrupted moments levity 
humour can take tension away scene faster shoddy special effect poor acting 
several tense moments become completely diffused misplaced jokes 
also couple plot developments left unresolved though mention give much away 
kevin bacon handles duel task playing everyman man losing sanity admirably 
 total lack understanding happening believable reactions wife maggie 
kathryn erbe given role meatier better written wife can longer handle husband parts 
 still supporting role maggie moving watches husband son enter calls private club im invited whisper things day long 
 jake zachary cope equals performance haley joel osment sixth sense gets less screen time 
 children manage trick making audience creeped apparent acceptance way things 
fans blair sixth sense will almost surely love stir echoes 
 combines dread blair creepy closedin feel thanks cinematographer fred murphy great performances whole cast specifically bacon give fall first genuine scary film 
 let unneeded funny bits tweaked plot bit one years best
