 meet joe black runs just three hours 
ive always thought obscene running times limited historical epics 
 meet joe black neither historical epic though get feeling martin brest director desperately wants 
every single scene movie goes minutes long 
 ending takes minutes longer really 
 severe editing job made movie excellent instead just good 
pitt actor normally loathe actually quite engaging death 
 believed performance see forlanis character fall love 
 agree roger ebert though found hard believe entity thats around time wouldnt know peanut butter 
 nothing pitts performance course little distracting 
hopkins gives usual excellent performance 
hes able portray angst man knows little time left without making obnoxious whiner 
 first major studio role claire forlani surprisingly good 
 sweet tenderness allows audience instantly root 
 meet joe black good movie hampered ridiculous running time 
 film cut hour doubt calling one best movies year review
