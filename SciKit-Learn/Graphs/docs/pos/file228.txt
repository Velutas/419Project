 submarine genre movies seems one intriguing compelling types storytelling 
think 
 films completely based reality yet handful people ever one making fascinating general public 
 arent like movies take place plane train anybody can get one 
 arent like movies happen outer space either ones done stuff yet 
 new one comes dont hear anyone say ugh another submarine movie like people tend say ugh another boxing movie 
look modern movies involve submarines das boot abyss hunt red october crimson tide 
 well regarded topnotch entertainment 
gladly joining bunch u stars matthew mcconaughey executive officer u s naval submarine world war ii 
 learn denied recommendation command superior bill paxton 
mcconaugheys crew receives orders will boarding disabled german submarine steal enigma german communications encoding device stumped allied intelligence 
 mission goes horribly wrong however result mcconaughey handful crew well captured german become trapped aboard u enemy waters 
 first great thing u films opening sequence 
 german crew u attack sets events rest film motion 
 tense exciting fascinating 
 applaud filmmakers copping instead keeping entire sequence german english subtitles 
 movies scene long panicked german crew speaking english right away 
 plot gets moving u gives us action sequence action sequence making audience wonder ok now get 
 stakes keep raising much like executive decision excellent actionthriller even though audience knows film will end lot fun getting 
 two minor complaints entire film 
 first comes scenes follow opening sequence 
 purpose introduce us characters get story going feel though done much quicker less conventionally 
 mean really see ships crew wedding 
 now know exactly whats going happen groom 
 gripe films finale 
theres explosion ends film one weakest looking cgi effects since presidents plane crashed ocean end air force one 
 stress enough 
 cgi effect can made look like model effect stick using models 
yes u historically incorrect surely specifics plot people onboard submarine will tell couldnt happen overall point film entertainment 
 succeeds fantastically
