 entertaining hours awaits audience film set early s 
sevigny beckinsale play disco chicks alice charlotte lookout love 
alice mousy shy intellectual charlotte bitchy outgoing fun 
 join adventures go variety adventures men background local disco 
whit stillman written directed interesting believable story 
alice charlotte well written characters actresses play arent bad aswell 
sevigny delivers honest performance makes audience feel character 
beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified yet character never becomes completely unlikeable 
 huge supporting cast also play part making sure movie thoroughly entertaining 
 dialogue sharp well written many funny set pieces 
 example theres great discussion lady tramp main characters 
 disco tunes playing background also make sure admittedly long film good fun 
 direction good bringing drama comedy scenes 
 slight flaws movie 
firstly although supposedly set s characters s 
 way dress act s feel 
although male hairstyles look slightly s frankly s atmosphere just wasnt conveyed shame 
also mentioned film long parts lag 
 charm characters help moments generally editing bit tighter 
 plot also sidetracks silly cocaine dealing bust seemed place movie 
finally almost many characters film despite running time film never really spends enough time 
 characters slight shame 
 conclusion funny also surprisingly weak certainly strong enough 
 despite qualms last days disco funny warm movie certainly worth seeing fitting homage disco era s 
worth look 
overall rating
