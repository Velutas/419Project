 much wanted like film went pleased left 
first getting usual lines newspaper glitz liked scream youll love wild things 
 campbell gives stunning performance 
 twisty plot will dazzled days 
 oh yeah day newspaper uses day neve campbell falls love 
now onto serious stuff film mean nearly sarcastic way 
wild things singlehandedly broken rules surrounding r rating mpaa 
im saying bad way see film may shocked see 
however perhaps mpaa pleased films charming cast tricky plot let film slide r rating 
 mormon im bound hear uproar religious zealots warning see film 
trouble already seen 
 like 
wild things film noir s filled s sensibilities yet breaking rules modernday taboos s culture 
 style filmed rich color 
 actors gorgeous people seemingly drawn gene pool placed film 
sure good true aint fun watch 
 movies like come along sort better version basic instinct bound people either love hate 
 will people dont want admit liking see tell anyone sees will like 
wild things begins blue bay high school one high school world teenager love get 
 almost students put entrance exams just admittance totally based looks alone 
 course select may look slightly ugly compared average person gorgeous 
immediately film finds tone audience settles enjoyable time 
 can turn brains right 
wrong 
 may expecting one thing happen certainly doesnt turn way 
 film begins classroom nearly main characters present 
theres sam lombardo matt dillon counselor students 
hes heading class discussion 
theres also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen fallen love sam 
teaching class however two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon gloria perez daphne rubinvega want talk sex 
 cheers crimes boos 
 sex crime 
ray asks 
 gettin 
one student responds 
 pretty much sets tone film watch 
however upon hearing one student suzie toller neve campbell stands leaves room commenting can kiss part body 
 wild things sets motion 
quickly kelly begins hitting sam sam doesnt want anything advances 
kelly stubborn continues pursue 
 even pleads let wash jeep 
surprisingly thats really can tell plot 
 give away one many crucial plot twists 
 whats plot twists actually unpredictable 
going along way scream wild things maintains films surprises adds even 
 plot twists film probably ever seen 
 even though think may get tired surprises genuine rather pleasing 
going back mind nearly work though stretch boundaries belief 
thankfully convoluted plot doesnt give us much time think one pouncing yet another twist us shock previous one worn 
 critics complain film trashywell 
 pretty much just one trashy film 
however kind trashy isnt hard watch 
 good trash sense 
one screenplay knows taken seriously includes lot humor satire story 
 varies everywhere kellys mother theresa russell caricature rich people way ambulancechasing lawyer bill murray wears neckbrace cover insurance scam running 
bill murray also provides best character film genuine laughs 
 two sex gratuitous although unwelcomed 
wild things supposed sex film title wouldnt movie breaks boundaries 
instead heterosexual sex scenes also includes lesbian scenes denise richards neve campbell dont worry 
 graphic might think 
 heterosexual scenes quite graphic surprise shocker kevin bacons fullfrontal nude scene 
 brief blink may miss ahem 
 long can remember dont think seen rrated film show erect one completely judging audiences reaction expected 
also one scene late film seemed relationship brewing bacon dillons characters nothing came makes wonder director cut order r rating actors refused 
 first made want see wild things cast 
neve campbell course one favorite actresses since scream films released 
 however turns every typical role done head plays gothic pothead 
 closest role performance craft though even nice girl 
campbell probably best film shows wide range talent 
 can tell will around long time 
denise richards will also around long time although may limited roles without much range 
 gets express emotions stiff yet effective performance starship troopers 
hopefully one day will land good role can display ability 
 daphne rubinvega newcomer movies 
 gives good performance although character mostly left background first hour half 
towards end get bigger part 
 male side matt dillon probably best giving subtle performance surprises every twist 
kevin bacon slightly wooden character makes 
 must admiration though screen 
 judging many womens reactions theater shot grown deeper appreciation bacon yeah right 
 bill murray 
 performance comic relief nearly steals film 
 whole entire cast works wondrously together seem home even menage troi 
director john mcnaughton previously done critically acclaimed henry portrait serial killer constructed wonderfully twisty plot works 
 direction smooth stylish 
 visuals striking filled rich colors almost realistic can actually breathe humidity air 
however seems home actors arent talking 
 flyby shots swampy areas brilliant photography denise richards climbing pool highlight 
 cinematography gorgeous details often see film like watch just see camera can take pictures 
 music 
 probably obvious thing set perfect mood film 
 hard describe words just see film listen 
 wonderfully composed presented 
 sure stick around closing credits 
mcnaughton finally put ending credits good use comedies use outtakes 
 included small scenes help explain preceding events 
 may say lame attempts explain convoluted plot entertaining way finish film 
plus shocking moments ending credits just add fun 
wild things appropriately rated r strong sexuality nudity language violence 
 nudity rather unnecessary lets face itpeople want see 
 give 
neve campbell admirably nonudity clause contract see behind takes top way go neve 
 sex scenes graphic especially first one see mother one deck hands 
one almost wonders got away r rating 
 language quite harsh ranging sexual innuendo average everyday profanity 
 cant stress enough dont allow kids see film 
 target age movie range thats see 
 definitely 
 mention film rated r however get chance watch will probably likely pleased may even take friends see next time
