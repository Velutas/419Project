disaster films tendency formulated cliched 
 see disaster film actual originality least decent plot twist definitely welcome surprise 
unfortunately folks likely 
dantes peak cliched times corny also pretty decent 
 honest wasnt interested seeing film word mouth well several reviews didnt make sound promising 
 pleasantly surprised find movie wasnt bad 
 pretty run mill something say merely ok watch 
 case dont know dantes peak volcano city lives shadow dantes peak wouldve guessed eh 
pierce brosnan plays volcanologist sent study volcano perhaps hunch actual scientific proof determined volcano will arupting near future 
due lack substantial evidence nobody warns small town finally middle town meeting volcano finally blows 
brosnan around good guy will course save day
