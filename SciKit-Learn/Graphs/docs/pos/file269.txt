 happy bastards quick movie review 
analyze 
 one comedy focused mob 
well years ago sly little comedy called freshman marlon brando romp sendup famous don corleone character recently utterly stupid bad way movie mafia 
failed really get joke 
 time around however warner bros may gotten right analyze movie hits targets misses 
 plenty reasons 
 story goes like 
 mobster robert deniro finds receiving several panic attacks late fueled stress upcoming mobster meeting neardeath following driveby shooting 
 attacks prompt hire psychiatrist billy crystal whos mostly reluctant take mobsters case two reasons 
first course hes mobster secondly hes trying get married enjoy quiet honeymoon wife lisa kudrow kid 
 course cant rest worth moment mobsters goons always needing shrink something quick consultation dream analyzation 
fortunately movie played plenty laughs 
director harold ramis also helmed comedy multiplicity wasnt half bad keeps tone peppy light even sometimes sprinkled slight dramatic moments shootings cant always taken laughs know 
deniro finest comic work since king comedy giving somewhat similar performance role goodfellas bit lighter heart 
 scene tries display anger phone fails miserably hilarious 
crystal plays excellent straight man deniros character uplifting bombs fathers day giant 
kudrow also hoot crystals wifetobe whos verge breakdown thanks deniros presence 
 movie perfect 
 really thanks simplistic ending slightly wasted moments character portrayed chazz palminteri hes comic actor come give enjoyable romp lets deniro something different change taking dramatic act new field comedy 
kudos crystal kudrow just making show either 
line movie crystal said needed family therapy family mind
