 words brought world sultry vampire seductress name lilith silver played eileen daly 
made immortal century half ago sinister ethan blake continues alleviate boredom state 
 whats undead girl except squeeze tightest fitting clothes possible get guns seduce guys kill people money blood 
 way let say 
 film bad 
 film really really bad 
yet somehow strangely enjoyable 
 elements direct video horror flick buxom babes gore cheesy dialogue bad acting casual film viewer inclined spend money renting innocent blood going see blade 
still considered one finest british vampire film 
agreed might far best vampire flick ever 
period 
razor blade smile rather high production values shown nice overall tone film 
 film also bit departure popular vampire lore vampire can go broad daylight without disintegrating doesnt sleep coffin leaves one next computer sees religion opium peoples hence immunity crosses 
 aside doesnt stray far away horror film conventions 
 unless intentional 
razor blade smile literally goes throat pumps wound full processed cheese 
 cant help laugh female vampire gets decapitated severed head goes flying puddle 
youll laugh even harder hideously contrived situations distract two female guards lilith tosses cellular phone towards dials number 
youll laugh hardest murder witness recants tale suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably 
 theres sudden twist ending enough heart give away 
 film refuses take seriously good thing time lilith zips skintight body suit unzips just show right amount cleavage youve likely forgotten main point story 
 case really care shes assigned kill bunch people belong socalled illuminati shes leaving huge mess behind police find 
 much criticisms movie works best guilty pleasure film watch friends within groups 
almost destined cultstatus films campy cheesy overtones actually work towards film 
 may necessarily film youd want seen watching makes fun time movies
