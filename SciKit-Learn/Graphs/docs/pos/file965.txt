youve got think twice go see movie title like maximum risk 
 title generic 
 meaningless 
 cant believe good business 
 pick phone dial film world supposed remember new jeanclaude van damme movie one looked kind cool trailers directed chinese hot shot called geez maximum risk 
yuck 
 movie deserves attention 
 sweet bloody thrills one beats summer blockbuster competition handsdown 
 mission impossible came close delivering skillful thriller ill give maximum risk edge simply slick tom cruise picture therefore gratifying execution 
much surprise van damme continues develop pleasant unpretentious action hero 
 track record isnt solid schwarzeneggers hes hell lot adventurous arnold 
 van damme worked hong kongs premier hardcore action director john woo fairly lame movie called hard target 
 can find bootleg copy woos radically different directors cut much better eventually released 
 followup directed ringo lam city fire full contact whose hong kong films distinguished action pictures consistently played second fiddle woos operatic offerings 
 surprise maximum risk effective hollywood action flick either hard target woos subsequent broken arrow 
heres rundown 
van damme plays french cop named alain moreau shaken policeman friend jeanhugues anglade finds corpse thats alains exact double 
turns alain separated birth twin brother michael killed russian heavies strangely american looking cops 
alain investigating 
 finds michael booked flight new york city received message someone named alex bohemia 
assuming michaels identity alain flies new york gets tangled michaels girlfriend natasha henstridge fbi russian mob little odessa 
thats much need know 
 story adequate overly involving major plot points basically explained twice just case go popcorn wrong moment 
theres love story didnt find terribly convincing partly exmodel henstridge highstrung highprofile debut precious lines alien ice queen species 
shes great look can certainly read line cant really described acting 
 course acting isnt really hired lost track whether shirt comes often van dammes 
 movie exceptionally violent bordering gratuity 
 keep mind planning date 
 stunts spectacular fact can spot van dammes standin makes work less impressive 
theres much can car wreck movie makes crisp effective use pileups handful frenzied destruction derbies 
 lam surprising innovative sense exactly camera go catch bit action 
 main difference lam woo believe woo relies sheer spectacle gas action show pieces lam figured using cinematic space doublebarreled points view make things run 
dont get wrong chow yunfat soars space pumping bullets two pistols chewing toothpick glass confetti littering air around woos hardboiled amazing moment 
 moment thats hard reproduce hollywood 
 one thing hollywood doesnt yet chow yunfat 
 woos hollywood movies look like work talented upstart maximum risk surprisingly confident picture 
 first shot film awkward overhead view chase streets european city lams use odd camera angles becomes efficient later 
 film editing particularly savvy complement lams shooting style accentuating rather amplifying action 
 performances used fine tuning particular theres annoying overwritten manhattan cab driver early scenes toned jettisoned completely movie doesnt always overcome limitations genre 
 story little mundane although effective moments involving van dammes unrequited feelings toward brother never knew 
 often hollywood cranks truly satisfying action picture doubly surprising one come mere whisper publicity 
van damme fans treat may well mans best movie international action buffs will doubt savor flavorful hong konghollywood hybrid
