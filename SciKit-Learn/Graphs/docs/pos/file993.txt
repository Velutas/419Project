 film unexpected scary original caught guard threw loop 
okay isnt quite original considering sequel box office hit species certainly smart 
 films genre reminiscent cheesy bhorror films s s even become 
however learned smallbudget horrorscifi film sometimes expectations can shattered 
 lot criticism gone film read far anywayyep two reviews makes wonder types films automatically dismissed gory laughable pieces trash 
 thing isnt 
 well made well acted quite intelligent 
 can see critics now complaining level gore level sexuality film 
 species series isnt lack elements 
 much can get one film 
 yet behind basic premise allows get away 
species ii begins present day though seems alternate universe 
many films especially scifi ones create similar timelines realistic one change fit films needs 
species ii begins arrival american spacecraft excursion landing surface mars 
aboard patrick ross justin lazard bright handsome astronaut 
patrick son senator ross james cromwell just wants patrick succeed 
well seem succeeded 
landing surface mars first human ever 
 course isnt first ever 
 billion years ago alien species supposedly landed mars destroyed perfect living conditions able sustain life 
now course red planet cold rocky 
 life lives 
 visible life 
patrick upon leaving spacecraft landing red soil collects samples ground 
 takes aboard puts storage 
unfortunately one samples contains form life gets loose heated aboard ship 
just prior heading back earth life form creeps along floor inhabits earthlings 
 pass approximately seven minutes shrug nothing cant even remember 
 blame technical malfunction 
back earth patrick begins strong urges mate many women possible 
 know original alien wants breed take planet 
however children bred halfhuman father 
patrick really looking another alien breed finds eve natasha henstridge 
eve cloned dna taken sil original alien 
however time around alien urges either decreased dramatically lie dormant 
 project led dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising role species motives seem respectable 
since involved original alien attack wants learn stop alien come 
 
storywise species ii much stronger predecessor also much stronger say aliens hey love film cant tell strong story 
 surprised film incorporation historical facts screenplay 
 search extraterrestrial intelligence course college learned piece rock mars landed one poles 
 piece rock contained fossils may proof life mars later proven living creature created 
 script uses effectively also manages provide wellbalanced plot 
beginning first man mars something always dreamed seeing hoping film turn element useful starting point movie 
 quite well 
 characters smart know 
 character seems little cliched general george dzundza yet remains logical everything 
 obvious flaws course mostly lying technical aspects 
 special effects mediocre just plain bad 
 part remain believable even noticed homage alien series mothers gave birth alien children 
also realistic ones usually goriest ranging people torn open someones head blown 
however plot elements also may elicit laughs audience including menage troi necessary 
many people dislike species series excuse sex nudity gory violence 
however tend disagree 
 alien films 
 alien species ever come earth sole purpose destroy us wouldnt mate quickly possible many people possible 
 gripe scene patrick goes searching mate grocery store 
 didnt realize aliens picky choosing women mate just assume parthuman side looking beautiful one 
 acting quite good kind film 
 vast improvement first film least 
 acting key element film bad lowered camp good asked comparison films like aliens 
okay isnt good 
george dzundza probably obvious mistake casting overthetop impersonation general makes annoying distracting 
natasha henstridge limited time around usually enclosed cage 
however manage impressive performance aspect hindering talent 
oh yeah shes quite fun just plain watch 
marg helgenberger immensely better time around performance probably best film 
michael madsen soso isnt annoying soon becomes rather appealing nice cynic personality 
james cromwell small part makes much better incapable actor 
 say film james cromwell dramatically increases likeability 
mykelti williamson gives enjoyable performance gives film downtoearth feel 
 course justin lazard 
lazard far ridiculed performance think effective 
sure wooden isnt character like 
 moment touches glass separating henstridge extremely well done due couples acting 
species ii rated r strong sexuality scifi violencegore language 
 definitely r rated film young kids see 
 likely probably nightmares never sex rest lives 
hell dont even know will 
 sure critically lambasted film turns surprise film year 
 probably wont see another film expecting little got much quite 
director peter medak crafted suspenseful sometimes scary movie mediocre series 
medak also mastered wonderful jump 
moments probably second scariest moment ever seen film scream still first 
strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting surehanded director species ii exactly films entertaining
