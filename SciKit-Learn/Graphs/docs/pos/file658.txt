 s produced two brilliant science fiction films 
one gattaca 
 thirteenth floor 
just gattaca overshadowed mighty titanic thirteenth floor relegated obscurity matrix 
however thirteeth floor though deals similar themes much better movie frenetic childish improbable matrix 
 cutting edge computer scientist hannon fuller played charming armin muellerstahl murdered 
 associate douglas hall craig bierko apparently framed suspected police enters simulated world created order unravel mystery 
along way beautiful blonde gretchen mol bodies deepening mystery simulated worlds complicate picture 
 thirteenth floor unfolds slowly telegraphs punches choosing elicit complex emotional response empathy anticipation rather cheap one mere surprise 
 result movie failure two conventional points view 
first plot revelations can foreseen one carefully followed complex storyline 
second seriously demands audience think feel 
 wonder fell cracks 
done film noir style murder mystery relatively deep movie functions several levels 
many audiences will simply bewildered rather engaged shame movie amply repays little emotional intellectual investment 
 recommend second viewing simply get flavor frequent ironic foreshadowing opening parts movie 
despite philosophical challenges thirteenth floor derives emotional force love story jane fuller mol douglas hall bierko well close friendship douglas hall hannon fuller 
 sense akin gattaca matrix cute philosophical byplay adolescent movie emotional depth whatsoever 
 moment jane fuller confesses love douglas hall satisfying wrenching intellectually challenging 
 final moments film even takes david janes husband come enjoy killing accuses sick one 
although victory leading characters resolution suggests disturbing element fantasy jane thus deepseated character flaw 
 fact hannon fullers activities simulated world behavior janes husband effects entering simulation douglas hall hint similar issues characters 
 film good people beset without great evil 
 tragedy stars 
 major actors required play two even three roles perform extremely well 
bierko will familiar psycho long kiss goodnight outstanding 
donofrio whitney plays pivotal role support also turns good performance 
 lovely gretchen mol whose elegance integrity determination suggest bergman casablanca wonderful job 
 voice however lacks necessary weight times 
 given worst lines movie whose major weakness script 
 minor flaws hairline cracks fine porcelain appear places 
 one two instances jerky editing 
 script takes edge films climaxes 
 atmosphere becomes claustrophobic times yet clue 
one wonders even two decades blade runner still casting long shadow scifi films 
one can see group suits suite waving hands imperiously directors like emperor amadeus make likeblade runner know dark rainy 
 thirteen floor rare exception among hollywood movies rich emotionally satisfying intelligent scifi movie 
 yet ultimately proves suits right 
 good scifi made sf community turning droves see 
 dont support great sf will
