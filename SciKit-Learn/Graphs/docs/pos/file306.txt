 films ive come see year think chasing amy many laughoutloud moments 
im saying hysterically rolling floor watching waiting guffman mouth burst open least delighted guffaw least every couple minutes 
 think im kind person laughs least movies even find funny 
usually can get warm smile get laughing loud frequently really good sign 
waiting guffman story blaine missouri town celebrating th anniversary musical put big event 
 play directed corky st clair christopher guest also wrote directed mockumentary well cowriting several original musical numbers effeminate broadway hopeful determined make production smashing success 
teaming st clair handful blaine residents allan pearl eugene levy jewish dentist spent youth class clown sitting right next studying ron sheila albertson fred willard catherine ohara respectively married couple setting sights hollywood libby mae brown parker posey dense fun queen dairy queen others 
everybody movie brilliant absolutely levy particularly stands 
 characters portrayed saddening realism cant help love pathetic really 
although levy stands guest willard ohara posey wonderful definitely commended performances 
 oscar ensemble performance group sweep 
 humor tad uneven rest film even starting humorously nearly lost tadtoolong intros 
 delightful began get monotonous 
thankfully just say ok maybe run bathroom finally get past intros onto rehearsal scenes 
like play film gives threeact feel intros funny almost long rehearsals even funnier finally actual performance play excellent 
like said character really shines even done subtle approach 
 cant really watch people think theyre real people 
even way talk awkward pauses stumbles dont feel staged feel like youre watching real albeit funny documentary 
 even silly lyrics original songs play finally put absolutely wonderful 
 word note despite r rating waiting guffman really quite clean 
 rating came brief brief use granddaddy swear words 
even really bothers let say presented vulgar cheaplaugh way 
 actually quite humorous tastefully done 
 might hard knowing expect waiting guffman 
 silly humor also dry subtle intelligently done youre insulted 
 always really nice see comedy isnt slapstick vulgarity film one better ones better ones 
id recommend seeing
