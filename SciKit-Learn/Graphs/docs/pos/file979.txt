double jeopardy based assumption legally false 
 law stating nobody can convicted twice crime assumes crime time place circumstances 
 like matters 
 rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast furious 
 silly alright kind film just dont question 
 films plausibility everything 
double jeopardy however concerned making sense sole purpose entertain 
judd helps film tremendously difficult role 
 breakout boxoffice performance terrific 
 brings emotion onedimensional role giving movie little soul go along effective chase scenes action set pieces 
tommy lee jones basically just reprises role won oscar fugitive movie makes good use stonefaced wit 
thankfully double jeopardy refrains developing romance libby travis subplot doubtlessly interfered films story 
 one movies cops bad guys took sort sick pleasure 
 sheer anarchy proceedings nothing short wonderful ashley judd kicks crap every authority figure book 
 idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents virtues american legal system great see movie doesnt much demonstrate fallacy delights failure 
double jeopardy really good isnt kind good remembered recognized awards 
 one movies better viewed brain turned otherwise brain will busy ruining experience 
 thriller isnt concerned smart plausible 
instead diverts attention action year second none
