 john malkovich type film need see 
todays films either blockbusters entertain us tiresome formulas similar themes 
malkovich falls none categories quite refreshing see occur 
 strangely provoking story actually somewhat understandable 
john cusack plays puppeteer trying make big time 
 wife cameron diaz supports working petstore explains obscure pets keep apartment 
 cusack finally realizes needs get job finds ad filing clerk 
 reaches building arrives floor 
 discovers secret portal leads john malkovich minutes time 
meanwhile cusack meets business partner catherine keener falls madly love 
 problem interest ever 
 whole portal thing isnt just toy fact becomes cusacks dream 
 inside malkovichs mind gave opportunity basically control mlakovich like puppet fulfill fantasies 
 dont want give away much cusack becomes attached discovery 
 opinion idea absolutely brilliant 
 really quite scary think someone become control 
 makes wonder act like sometimes blurt things act something blue 
even script super sharp cant help find ending displeasing 
 lead something least amusing conclusion 
 tried explain mythology portals made seem rushed 
 enjoyable time 
 acting quite delightful well 
john cusack finally given chance prove ability well 
hes far underrated actor due lack popularity im hoping will change 
cameron diaz usual charming self although felt part wrong pulled 
john malkovich continues creep people eerie facial expressions tone voice 
 elses mind better explore 
 director spike jonze appeared last months three kings really catches attention project 
 knew bizzare extreme 
 likely receive media attention 
 john malkovich isnt excellent film definitly entertaining will eaisly become cult favorite 
whats even better films puzzling message
