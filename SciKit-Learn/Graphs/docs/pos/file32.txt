youve heard hype 
youve seen faces natalie portman professional queen amidala liam neeson schindlers list quigon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotting obiwan kenobi jake lloyd jingle way young anakin skywalker 
 youve read reviews youve also probably heard movie fails live magic humanity first trilogy 
 also may heard ones kiddiefriendly doesnt enough content adults 
believe hype 
 effects stunning digitalized creatures amazingly realistic lightsaber duels amazing queen amidalas sumptuous robes fit worn queen elizabeth 
 theres something missing isnt budget effects everything money cant buy 
 actors struggle best can flesh broadstroked flat characters 
 successful liam neeson quigon jinn jedi master young obiwan kenobi quiet dignity wise commanding presence 
 anchor movie one character george lucas apparently spent time fleshing 
portmans queen amidala mcgregors obiwan kenobi dont fare nearly well 
amidala future mother luke leia queen peaceful planet invaded trade federation comes stoic stilted caricatured appears though vulcan geisha former life 
 obiwan although mcgregor makes endearing little screen time hes nothing robin quigon jinns batman 
however mcgregor struggle manfully infuse surprisingly small supporting role spark genuine insight humanity good job 
 also absolutely nails alec guiness obiwan episode scottish accent really makes presence film profound might otherwise 
 fact lucas seems bank preexisting knowledge quite bit thats one problems film 
 never call star wars fan especially considering means fanatic days ive always enjoyed films along everyone else america 
however one person america hasnt seen films even recently doesnt bother brushup names obscure characters may hopelessly lost 
 example one films main nefarious characters senator palpatine 
 recently steeped star wars trivia emperor palpatine scary hooded apparition darth vaders master return jedi empire strikes back 
 obviously appearance phantom menace meant stir echoes later role series thus making role meaningful 
 lot movie like 
rd cpo make token appearances obvious lucas banking audiences preexisting fondness 
 doesnt much add way 
 goes jabba hutt doesnt look much mean corpulent lazy 
even planets make foreshadowing guest appearances film tatooine desert world luke grew coruscant cloud city empire strikes back alderaan leias home planet never actually see gets blown star wars show mentioned briefly passing 
whats result tying many plot points characters future films 
 answer one seems surprisingly empty 
theres meat substance makes want love characters will 
another problem actually many alien characters film 
 distracted fact two main evil characters strange looking aliens looked like gila monsters mouths barely moved making look like muppets actual characters 
 jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character intended comic relief really becomes annoying fast 
unlike chewbacca cpo got humanity youll pardon expression interactions human characters jar jar often left interact mostly others kind times making movie seem like nothing expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles 
furthermore dialogue often stilted corny sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering characters nothing bystanders plot 
oddly isnt just judgment lucas said designed film kids 
well hes done good job 
 hero film course young anakin hard feel kinship identify eightyearold boy 
thats jake lloyds fault though good job cute kid apparently lucas asked 
thats another mistake course cute tyke becomes darth vader 
warning spoilers ahead 
 opinion nearly enough foreshadowing anakins future evil film 
 boy blond flowing hair rosy cheeks theres nothing spark aggression throughout entire movie 
 doting mother pernilla august making first english language film slave gross flying gnome tatooine 
 indication audience gets kid isnt hearts roses yodas hesitation allowing train jedi quigon jinn 
 explanation 
 future clouded 
 warning major spoiler ahead 
enter risk 
 course noble quigon dies hand darth maul scarylooking sith lord excels jedi arts turned dark side 
 dude maybe two lines entire movie establishes presence amazing moves doublesided lightsaber scary facial makeup 
 quigon never gets chance train young anakin ways force obiwan quigons young padawan apprentice one level knightdom must take training 
 end movie end saga actually begins obiwan kenobi young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker 
 story need told 
 say 
 worthwhile movie see 
absolutely 
 dont enter theater jedisize expectations simply want treated enjoyable visual spectacle movie 
 tatooine pod races triumph effects computer animation 
 digitalized backgrounds planets astonishing sight 
 yoda young obiwan worth seeing origins simpler happier time 
 fun movie 
 deep meaningful profound 
 fun 
maybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan cowrite script guy directed empire will direct 
 lucas next one will lacking one thing needs potential
