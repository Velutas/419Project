 may unusual themes fashion motion picture rudolphs atypical approach characters situations makes intriguing always pleasant movie 
 said rudolph polarizing director meaning viewers either love work hate 
 mrs 
parker overly impressed movies 
 found equinox last pre mrs 
parker effort irritating frustrating 
 somewhat surprised therefore discover liked afterglow 
 several reasons paramount one rudolph seems muted strident mannered aspects approach 
 characters like real people genuine problems story absorbing acting topnotch 
 short rudolph created world worth spending two hours 
afterglow introduces us two unhappily married couples 
jeffrey byron jonny lee miller cold seeminglyheartless businessman sexually indifferent young wife marianne lara flynn boyle 
 part marianne obsessed baby never attempts interact husband human level 
 shes interested seducing days shes ovulating 
 refuses make love decides find someone else play role sperm donor 
 couple lucky nick nolte phyllis mann julie christie older pair theyre content jeffrey marianne 
 mysterious fracture past relationship driven apart 
 remain married matter convenience since phyllis wont allow lucky touch unspoken agreement whereby can fool around much wants provided lasting bond established result affairs 
 landscape emotional pain palpable 
 four characters begin interacting marianne hires lucky handyman fix inside apartment shares jeffrey 
 two immediately attracted one another doesnt take long theyre lounging together naked pool 
meanwhile jeffrey captivated older women runs phyllis hotel bar smitten invites accompany weekend retreat mountains 
 romantic couplings characters interesting illustrate multiple faces love 
sex means something different everyone jeffrey unpleasant chore loss control marianne means maternal end lucky enjoyable distraction blocks marital troubles phyllis method establishing denying emotional closeness 
ultimately none characters appears love anyone else much love 
 greatest strength film lies script performances 
jonny lee miller perfect selfish callous suitandtie businessman 
 recall sickboy trainspotting will find almost unrecognizable image conformity 
lara flynn boyle wasnt impressive rudolphs equinox greatly improved making marianne jumble sexiness vulnerability 
nick nolte delightful uninhibited lucky manages deliver rudolphs pregnant lines practiced ease 
 clear standout however julie christie nothing short delicious worldweary phyllis 
 often wry occasionally cutting asides source much films humor theres hardly ever moment doesnt steal spotlight costars 
 dont know afterglow film convert rudolph detractors seems movie little accessible directors earlier productions 
enough trademark style remains however reassure supporters 
afterglow basically fourpronged character study 
 plot especially compelling character interaction thats real reason see motion picture 
rudolph painted able picture nonromantic side love one tolerance familiarity affection attraction
