 problems physical appearance will able join rest us laughing allens intelligent observations life 
 problems verbal comedy may want skip one 
 film introduced audiences sparked imaginations showed something theyd never seen 
toy story used stateoftheart computer technology presented world toys come alive humans present 
many critics will call better film believe say completely original motion picture 
antz however upped ante considerably 
disneys bugs life isnt due another two months dreamworks seems received better end deal 
 beating disney satisfied audiences thirst computeranimated films 
 dont let fool disney definitely scared 
 past two years competitions broken studios 
 volcano duel 
 opinion dantes peak came way ahead predecessor time quality 
volcano original premise destroyed ridiculous situations 
 twice many competing films 
first comet competition armageddon blew away cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact 
 now even interesting one beloved studio disney goes newcomer dreamworks 
 will prevail 
time will tell im sure mr mouse nothing fear 
 may sound like didnt like antz contrary id put toy story 
 due pg rating many parents may put dialogue shouldnt appear disneys version 
 dialogue antz pushes envelope familyoriented film 
sexual innuendoes profanity pop occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared adult crowd 
 humor also written especially adults though many kids laughing theater attended 
 type film made families often entertaining kids entertaining parents 
antz begins hilarious monologue seems meld woody allens shtick franz kafkas metamorphosis short story man wakes discover bug 
z allen troubled ant believing made worker 
 youre middle child family five million comments neglected childhood 
one night z sitting bar friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing pathetic place life 
 walks princess bala sharon stone one recognizes without crown 
bala asks z like dance engage pulp fictionesque dance everyone else following leader 
 discovering princess z falls love theres problem bala getting married general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader merely wants control better stronger colony 
 order must eliminate queen anne bancroft weakest colony namely worker ants 
 get rid queen needs get rid loyal army ants willing die 
 colonel cutter christopher walkin come plan send loyal ants battle will surely killed 
 queen reluctant first decides best colony 
meanwhile z wants meet bala asks weaver army ant switch places 
 z gets sent battle manages survive slaughter termites 
 battle sequence absolutely stunning though may flashbacks starship troopers contained similar sequence 
however antz film production around time similarities merely coincidence 
 second half film revolves around zs kidnapping bala search mythical place called insectopia 
 ant can boss food wants 
 adventures z bala get surprisingly high tension especially one involving magnifying glass 
looming targets like spaceships independence day fact im just going assume producers referenced id intentionally 
 ants look awe beam fire blasts ground 
visually exciting rush adrenaline 
 dont fooled 
little kids shouldnt see may just try copy 
 seeing antz vowed never intentionally step ant 
hopefully children will learn killing ants rather cruel 
 animated film antz probably best will find date 
visually stunning dreams may come 
 best aspect animation fact characters arent limited gravity 
 can take ridiculous situations make seem plausible 
one great moment involves mass worker ants bunching form wrecking ball 
 animation perfect can virtually see every single ant ball 
however exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck bottom young boys shoe 
 truly great example film making finest 
 computer technology animators carefully made ants faces look similar actors providing voices 
 best example barbatus danny glover 
 one point can even see pores face although doubt ants pores 
 
barbatus also touching rather gruesome scene final words z without body 
young kids may disturbed site dismembered head good deal humor derived appropriate adults course 
disneys bugs life looks good dont know will able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation 
 dreamworks will done something studio go head head big mouse knock yes anastasia good nearly good even worst disney 
vocal talent always essential animated feature antz one best lineups seen since toy story 
 fact far exceeds one 
woody allen always funny transcends hes done past years 
without body comic timing noticeable thing 
 fact im pretty sure writers let improvise lot lines 
sharon stone bala shows comic ability though part stone works best dramatic actress 
sylvester stallone teamed stone beginning solidify statement wants actor typecast action star 
 snub oscars last year stallone proving serious comedic illustrated actor 
gene hackman superb grufftalking general almost another take crimson tide persona 
christopher walkin probably noticed voice many people will remember hits batman returns 
anne bancroft minimal role shes effective nonetheless 
danny glover small role good job 
dan aykroyd jane curtin also lend voices two lovesick eurotrash beesboth unrecognizable especially aykroyd 
jennifer lopez plays worker ant falls love weaver although people wont recognize voice either 
many people will recognize grant shauds voice foreman 
 played miles tv show murphy brown 
 definitely huge cast highprofile names will definitely help grosses 
 course can probably tell lot million budget went also 
directors eric darnell lawrence guterman relative newcomers though guterman direct feature headless 
 show incredible talent type picture 
tense times funny throughout two hold film together like professionals 
 screenplay todd alcott chris weitz quite simple plot contains lot subtlety makes film suitable adults 
kids will delight animation parents can laugh heartily humor 
 will go young childrens heads 
 mean shouldnt take kids see 
 
 will lot fun watching one 
 great themes given us 
part social commentary part romance story part moral drama antz gives everyone something talk whether animation discussions individualism community 
thankfully subtle either aspects 
antz rated pg mild language intense action 
sometimes language can pushing limits family movie violence keep kids home 
 battle scene ants melting acid bugs speared death 
 magnifying scene shows ant disintegrate beam sunlight 
 sexual innuendos perfect choice wholesome fun theaters 
 doubt many children will understand sexual innuendos unless old enough still advisable leave really young children home 
 confused enough 
 take kids recommend seeing film likely youll enjoy
