 chance create genetically perfect child 
 gattaca film presents future society answered yes question ponders actually right decision 
 gattaca came couple months following first genetically engineered creature lovable dolly sheep mind film becomes frightening 
 way realm genetics heading may take couple decades future gattaca presents becomes true 
contrary misleading trailers gattaca scifi thriller way theres lots murder hitchcockian suspense chase scenes 
 quiet sad film intelligent theories 
 fact film seems like written george orwell aldous huxley latter whos novel brave new world featured genetically engineered children 
 film may likely become cult hit people frightened promise shallow utopia exactly gattaca presents main reason dug much 
 story revolves around genetically insufficient vincent freeman ethan hawke man high hopes chance heart problems prospected life span around years 
 child put threats genetics younger genetically perfect brother anton loren dean promised whatever heart desired 
vincent yearns astronaut gets job giant space company janitor ernest borgnine plays boss 
 one day finds probably possible desires can come true form business deal brought black market geneticist something german wings tony shalhoub like hundreds cameos films back men black life less ordinary whos client genetically perfect man jerome morrow jude law unfortunately crippled 
fortunately though theres record accident hes willing give someone else life 
since vincent looks bit like 
 couple alterations minor really major donned life jerome job 
 meets genetically imperfect woman irene uma thurman whos genetically perfect real life anyway hee hee two begin kind relationship albeit shallow one since romance deemed great mans stats 
however murder highlevel worker office killed one vincentjeromes eyelashes found anal retentive investigators headed semiwily inspector hugo alan arkin none vincents long lost brother anton hasnt seen since teenagers 
 know vincentjerome didnt older picture posted everywhere vincentjeromes trouble also real jerome whos much 
however isnt many big suspense set pieces actually blessing tossed film lose message descend just scifi thriller la william gibson 
 suspense film comes idea vincent jerome can easily captured just dropping hair dead skin 
 several scenes pretty frightening big distractions point film much dismay commercial audiences 
 actually portrayed lack life utopian society created 
irene real spunk life rather amazed sheer beauty sunrise rather genetically perfect people 
 genetically flawless jerome actuality bitter man claiming accident really accident 
 jerome done fool system giving man yearns better things chance ending shocking definite work dystopian propaganda doesnt ending works kind 
 production design film probably best ive seen year stunning pleasing eye still cold 
since genetics ruled chance improvement world cooled state inhumanity sets echo sense shallow misery 
 sequence highlevel workers jobs kind gilliamesque feel showing nightmare slipping routine zombielike life 
 ability perfect people left humanity cold generally unhappy 
 acting everyone great thurman giving wonderfully cold performance hawke creating character beaten system found new sense optimism bitter man willing give anyway interesting pointless fact uma ethan started dating film currently pregnant child 
 best performance belongs jude law steals every scene hes creates character filled pessimism horrible burden placed burden 
 think people generally tempted fact genetics can actually create perfection child whether actually act temptation something im sure 
 gattaca warns us go farther chiefly well create world elitism elite shallow unhappy bitter angry lesser people 
 see possible future featuring fingered piano player well folks just creeps
