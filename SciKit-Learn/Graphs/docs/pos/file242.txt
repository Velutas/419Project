 job guess accomplishes bringing three films full circle upon first viewing seemed rather dissatisfying appears little contrived arbitrary second viewing endeavored upon due recurring disapprobation killer s identity still seems little random motivation came across sound time around eventual conclusion ultimately satisfying 
 scream fall victim lamented principle trilogy worst films 
 trilogy scream lot fun refreshing humorous offbeat 
almost sad see go 
 seem best quit re ahead scream fine job providing closure characters 
 now scream holds title finest series horror films committed celluloid 
 shabby
