 moonlighted actor several decidedly unmemorable performances 
now much fanfare anticipation tarantino returned third directorial effort jackie brown 
 motion picture adapted elmore leonards novel rum punch offers solid entertainment expecting another bravura outing tarantino will leave theaters disappointed 
 part jackie brown pretty ordinary crime movie 
 story starts slowly develops twisty affair doublecrosses triplecrosses 
 movie littered occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire s pop tunes closeups womens bare feet 
yet production something letdown 
 sheer inyourface exuberance marked reservoir dogs especially pulp fiction absent 
 mostlystraightforward chronology jackie brown doesnt match favorably nonlinear style tarantinos previous efforts approach added tension edginess narratives

 addition looking fantastic pam grier also quite good although oscar caliber performance although might get nomination 
robert forster michael keaton solid toughguyswhorarely smile roles 
bridget fonda around three discernible reasons look sexy bikini provide little twisted comedy satisfy tarantinos foot fetish
