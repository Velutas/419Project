 footloose one goal mind reel audience cheesy sentiment feelgood antics 
 hate admit fell 
 movie teenager bacon moves small town big city discovers dancing banned local reverend lithgow 
 ends falling preachers daughter singer showing whole town magic dance can 
 mentioned beginning review footloose extremely hokey predictable teen drama 
 virtually surprises writing secondrate 
 enjoy much 
 one thing cast great 
kevin bacon oozes charisma early role 
 rooting right start unlike films genre bacon doesnt play rebel without clue sort 
yes rebel hes also polite needs 
 never broods 
 rest cast equally impressive 
john lithgow seen playing normal guy change playing man normally flat villian 
 lithgow plays concerned father trying feels best daughter 
 end film feel genuine sense love understanding lori singer character 
another nice touch music 
 see parents kids complaining music listen filled sexual innuendos thats true 
 title track performed kenny loggins upbeat fun 
 final sequence overcome urge get couch start dancing 
 course soon realized little pathetic 
anyway footloose charming little surprise 
dont let premise prevent watching 
 sucked itll
