sarah finds henry bore well hes just normal guy 
 work play 
 maurice hand falls madly love sarah anything 
unfortunately two break 
 witnessed serious flashbacks leads us present 
 years later still think maurice hires private detective ian hart see sarah 
 may sound straight forward 
 deep dark tale jealousy lies two men unhappiness ever lasting love 
 may sound like drag really captures interest 
 great performances ralph fiennes another english patient type film movie better julianna moore definitely deserves oscar films believe role passion can see 
 story also well written thanks neil jordan 
even though didnt read book theres doubt mind just moving descriptive 
whats moving ask 
 tragedy 
 typical romance guy finds girl fall love well complicated depressing

everyone feels different way tears us pieces 
back neil jordans script wasnt red roses 
 times felt little slow romances 
 also tended bit confusing especially start 
 keep jumping around past present obviously took awhile get grasp things 
also notable superb direction neil jordan 
id say finest achievement date quite frankly ive never really found work par
