ingredients london gal fate true love running joke monty pythons spanish inquisition 
synopsis american actress gwyneth paltrow dark hair playing londoner 
believe 
sliding doors love story 
 gimmick really two stories film follows life helen gwyneth paltrow two directions 
 beginning likeable gal helen gwyneth paltrow gets unexpectedly fired advertising job 
 goes subway train station meaning return home early apartment sleeping livein lover gerry john lynch 
helen doesnt know fateful junction life enters sliding door london subway train life takes one path one future stays platform life takes another path different future 
 film shows happens paths switching back forth intertwined parallel stories 
 story one helen meets charming talkative monty python fan named james john hannah train 
arriving home early discovers livein gerry john lynch sex former lover lydia jeanne tripplehorn 
 leads life helen moves 
helens winsome new friend james helps recover broken heart encourages start business 
 story two helen experiences different fate 
 misses train never meets james doesnt get home early enough discover gerrys infidelity 
 new life helen takes odd menial jobs faces constant sneaking suspicion right relationship gerry 
will truth heart finally work way number problems setbacks scenarios 
opinion rejoice ye monty python fans gwyneth paltrow fans watchers quirky romance flicks 
 last heres proof theres still creativity s filmmaking 
sliding doors refreshingly different anything year 
 wellacted heartwarming film also easily gwyneth paltrows best recent performance 
 helen paltrow screams unfaithful boyfriend shagging wanker british phrase better left untranslated sounds like knows shes talking 
 sliding doors go overboard formulaic true love stereotypes 
nobody scrambles around danger screaming will find matter darling 
 helen finds boat starlight james doesnt take easy way leap arms since shes supposed recovering heartache 
 handsome livein boyfriend gerry isnt stereotypical screen hunk either stud snob 
instead hes nervous indecisive almost helpless hunk 
another example one protagonists lies wounded hospital sliding doors gives us neither hospital miracle maudlin tragedy surprises us third variation 
 words characters seem nonstereotyped human local 
 minor inconveniences 
since sliding doors switches back forth two possible fates occasionally difficult distinguish two 
distinguishing two stories isnt problem scenes containing paltrow sports two different hairstyles 
 scenes containing lydia gerry look stories slightly confusing 
also quite snappy comebacks referring american pop culture seinfeld woody allen etc spoken british characters 
 seem slightly forced given remaining dialogue predominantly british slang 
possibly attempt screenwriter balance british american audiences can feel comfortable 
sliding doors charming quirky original happy romance little philosophy fate thrown 
monty python meaning fate anybody
