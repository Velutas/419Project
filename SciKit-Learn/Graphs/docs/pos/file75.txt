im entirely sure exactly 
 many ways drunken master similar jackies early films fearless hyena ii master cracked fingers half loaf kung fu spiritual kung fu others 
 fact looking early films together one gets impression stamped cookiecutter style rate four six per year using casts telling similar stories 
 honest think early jackie chan movies something acquired taste 
theyre quite different action movies know america 
 films tend set chinese countryside indeterminate period sometime distant past fairly slow plots often meander far afield sometimes seem exist intention stringing comedy fight scenes together 
 drunken master though plot tighter exception 
 aside drunken master first jackie chan movie ever saw saw way meant seen 
 movie theater seattle part asian film festival 
 time didnt really think anything special 
 seen films like kind grown 
 drunken master s storyline similar early jackie chan movies fearless hyena ii master cracked fingers slacker martial arts student taught martial arts harshseeming master big fight evil bad guy end formula adapted put kindly american films karate kid 
 specifically jackie chan plays part wong feihong aka naughty panther funloving practicaljoking kung fu student good kung fu good quite good enough

 drunken master features wonderful martial arts sequences jackie winning fights losing others 
 said ill say againthese fights dont just happen theyre carefully choreographed ballet performance shows 
 fights jackie often makes use objects found environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits vegetablesoften new surprising ways 
 fight scenes particularly toward end film unparallelled american films 
whether jackie wins loses really something see 
 often funny anything 
 funny thing jackie chan good 
theres little thats new moviejackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly master jackie going punishment training 
schticks seen one several dozen similar jackie movies seventies early eighties 
 theyre still hilarious ever 
likewise jackie great supporting cast many also early jackie films theyre often source plenty hilarity 
 really big thing drunken master though inspired several copycats including couple starring jackie sequel fifteen years later drunkenstyle kung fu 
im certain whether actually genuine style kung fu principle behind imitate wobbly movements drunkard lull enemy false sense security 
 apparently helps youre drunk youre 
genuine admit theres just something incredibly fun watching fellow looks utterly sloshed wading group startled opponents making mincemeat even realize whats going 
come think perhaps element accounts films success jackie films 
 just martial arts kind martial arts makes stop go whoa 
 negative side cinematography film nothing special film stock rather primitive plot often rather slow subtitles sometimes extremely hard read background 
 gone wind isnt 
still like martial arts films like youve seen far jackie chan want see give shot 
 much real chuck norris jeanclaude van damme 
 might well like 
another interesting thing drunken master video availability us 
 drunken master early jackie chan movie know can find original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available vhs magnum video gold box 
 plenty early jackie films around typically either dubbed panandscanned form else import tapes priced rental instead purchase 
thankfully drunken master least available aspect ratio meant seen affordable price 
 like drunken master take look numerous early jackie chan films even dubbed ones arent really bad 
nothing else can enjoy martial arts choreography making fun dialogue 
 particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half loaf kung fu fearless hyena movies snake crane arts shaolin 
also mostlyunrelatedstorywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theaters american release sometime later year though americanrelease title will still uncertain comes highly recommended reviewer 
also rather different interpretation character wong feihong fact popular figure chinese folklore ive told suggest upon time china series starring jet li though havent personally seen yet 
 choose watch drunken master really hope enjoy hope starts open eyes wonderful world asian cinema thats 
 give film
