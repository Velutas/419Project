im quite sure best go writing review 
 must admit little disappointed barry levinsons political satire wag dog retrospect less film false expectations going 
quite reviews read led believe film absolutely hilarious make laugh loud whole way didnt 
 also led believe deliver vicious alltootrue attack way american political media works didnt quite either 
 even suggested prove worthy successor stanley kubricks dr 
strangelove tradition political black comedy definitely didnt 
 said wag dog actually clever satire shady manipulations political figures assist 
 story revolves around attempts political spin doctor conread brean robert deniro distract american public accusations president reelection two weeks sexually harassed young girl oval office 
 accusations script suggests probably untrue brean pointedly puts isnt particularly relevant scandal likely derail presidents campaign regardless truth falsehood 
brean along assistant anne heche decide contact hollywood producer stanley motss dustin hoffman enlist help concocting enough propaganda specialeffects trickery make appear u s going war albanian terrorists thus propel president victory wave patriotic fervor 
 said wag dog quite laughoutloud hilarious expected genuinely funny moments found echo familiar movie clich camera pans urban sunset strains uplifting inspirational music cuts studio reveal singing coming group musicians motss assembled perform right fight democracy 
another scene shows us modern editing equipment actress running across sound stage bag potato chips can turned frightened young girl kitten fleeing terrorist attack village 
 consistently effective gag revolves around propaganda teams attempt forge fictional war hero sgt 
william old shoe schumann woody harrelson exmilitary officer turns firstclass psycho 
 course everything goes planned cia example realizes whats going strikes deal presidents electoral opponent report media fighting ended forcing motss brean come new angle supposed albanian crisis 
still even cias involvement film falls little short terms making scenario believable 
regardless official word president cia wouldnt major media outlets eastern european correspondents verify fact fighting going albania 
 film never addresses question show reactions american public news apparent war except scenes border farcical basketball fans litter court shoes support aforementioned sgt 
schumann apparently meant assume everyone buying 
 also instance towards end film one motsss forced reinventions story seems contradict brean selling public thus far conceivably given game away 
 plot holes wag dog doesnt quite work satire american politics send mentality might lead kinds machinations first place 
brean advisors never seem concerned unethical rather worry convincing will whether enough money pull 
 film takes decidely dark turn towards end learn far willing go order keep propaganda campaign secret 
motss hollywood buddies meanwhile seem completely touch rest world just see undertaking another creative project 
 fact one sources conflict film motsss increasing restlessness idea able take credit producing fake war mind greatest work art ever created 
 think fair say wag dog underachieves little bit attention public reaction tighter plotting might made fourstar film classic satire 
still issue american president using war patriotism distract scandals domestic unpopularity real one 
wag dog takes issue one step asks war wasnt even real 
 premise talented cast film still delivers consistently whatever flaws
