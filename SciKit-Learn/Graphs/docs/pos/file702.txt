theater rating okay seats sound picture 
modern society now inundated sex sexuality ever teenage sitcoms ncrated films fetishes 
 biggest debate subject whether affects reality just reflects 
 friends neighbors takes different approach film revolves almost entirely around sex can used pain pleasure even within small circle friends 
one important aspects film noted analyzed film can really dissected whole writerdirector neil labutes basic setup unique methods employs tell story 
firstly importantly fact script tells rather complex detailed story lust betrayal arrogance hypocrisy greed just plain stupidity six different characters three men three women without hardly supporting characters line two mostly extras 
everything will somehow affect another character ultimately come fullcircle back whether positive negative 
 just state arbitrary explaining criticizing process difficult 
labutes ability tell story characters remarkable feat whats specifically impressive fact characters names never revealed end credits roll 
 sake review will describe characters refer main characteristic 
another interesting accomplishment fact every scene takes place inside limited focus 
 always able tell characters someones home gym restaurant hotel room etc city live year society like etc relatively unknown 
 film complete character study tight intense drama theater 
 one plot dominates story makes first act bit tedious lack background 
 simply dropped characters lives expected figure rest 
 characters group middleclass white people successful theyre concern right now seems sex lives 
first theres barry eckhart mary brenneman married couple going dry spell unlike many couples situations dont know theyre problem 
barry kind dorky businessman loves wife sex doesnt lot ambition just follows everyone else 
mary writer sort lacks aggression emotion like husband meekness character ironically doesnt hesitate commit adultery just feel something 
labutes script good job characterizing mary barry individuals light chemistry connection two 
obviously theme enhanced actors good performances time seems just bit hollow 
another couple jerry stiller terri keener live together seem involved long time yet constantly argue anything everything 
 sex life also fraught problems reason continue throughout infidelitous relationship 
 one aspect film use improvement area 
 natural married couple become bored two people can barely stand continue sex live together 
 ever see person begin 
labute never really answers since film concerned payoff process still makes good drama tension manip ulation intricate deceitful fascinating 
two characters act catalysts cary jason patric cheri natassja kinski 
cary arrogant hostile sexmaniac defines word bastard 
somehow able bend women will either charm just attitude getting way 
hes kind guy everyone stay away realize hes secretly perverted somehow barry finds comfort company although jerry always nervous around 
patric gives outstanding performance much want know despite intimidating unlikable 
cheri character labute uses catalyst see characters react 
 works art museum point throughout film character will engage almost exact conversation reaction always different becoming involved relationship one brushing small talk another outright appalled yet another 
shes sweet woman perhaps normal characters although symbolism obvious role outsider relatable 
 will reveal cheats character specifically affected others action thats hook film 
 first two acts begin set characters eachs scenarios often difficult tell will 
 result sometimes surprising times predictable actual course actions always fascinating 
 everyone fun ultimately characters guilt attitude ignorance will disserve 
one important things note realistic story supposed 
since characters interact isnt much pop culture references almost everything deeper philosophy behind 
 assume people title states friends neighbors 
 dont know anyone going situations people 
often times film unlike network melodrama times situations like seen outside porno movie 
 film others dont repercussions end 
although film creates reality goes show even immoral arent immortal 
 way friends neighbors supposed work open interpretation 
 definitely lot say price comes infidelity even better expanded theme specifically 
still accomplishment filmmaking put timeless theme modern perspective
