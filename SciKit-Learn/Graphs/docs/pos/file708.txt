 reunion film original idea way shape form 
 done throughout film history become one many subgenres like prep school subgenre angstfilled teen subgenre slasher subgenre 
 makes peters friends remarkable doesnt follow rules subgenre follows well creates characters wouldnt mind hanging 
 rules reunion subgenre 
well 
 need group friends married least dating sometimes even married dating eachother 
 need brought back together sort crisis 
 spoken together much since split apart 
 reunion come intervals divisible 
 slightly highly neurotic 
 reunion bring together seperate little crises bring back together theyre friends 
 sex least making either friends people invited 
 eightly theyre unhappy marginally 
 theres sort sexual tension amongst thats built years 
 friends wildly successful world entertainment arts sometimes internationally 
 film filled nostalgic radio hits time friends sometimes causing get together dancesong 
since follows rules closely will probably coined just british big chill 
 ways 
 follow rules said feature lots bitching big confessionals broken relationships 
 big chill least tad whiny unsatisfying peters friends hits mark making film funny dramatic poignant 
 friends peters theatre group back performig wildly outrageous british acts people far stuck enjoy opening scene dancing tux tops tutus 
 peters stephen fry wealthy father richard briers hardly screen enough register oh well dies leaving giant mansion decide whether keep 
 sure immeadiately decides throw giant reunion party inviting back old chums 
 course chums follow tenth rule 
andrew kenneth branagh also directing actor whos unhappily married tv star carol cowriter rita rudner 
maggie emma thompson successfuly publisher selfhelp books looks like needs customers lonely unhappy 
roger mary hugh laurie imelda staunton also married sense sensibility married successful creators jingles uk suffered tragedy one newly born twins recently died 
 sarah alphonsia emmanuel promiscuous ever new boyfriend two weeks named brian tony slattery whos married wants divorce giving doubts 
 peter things seem okay 
 film features lots innerfriend jokes even old theatre anecdotes least find lot fun ive done lots theatre 
 big confessions brawls friends end almost everyone unhappy even though resolved problems long end kinda dug 
 final twist seem forced anticlimactic reason felt way rest friends 
maybe people film likable just wanted join clique 
thats really makes peters friends lovable way just want hang group friends can dysfuntional sometimes someones crisis can come together wonderfully one another 
 giant crisis like people want selflessly help instead subtely pushing away makes realize true friends people true friends 
 mention kenneth branagh able make film seem nostalgic s decade grew unfortunately without taking us outside s 
 s classics anticlassics like tears fears everybody wants rule world unfortunately stupidfun s songs think ever s reunion film id put crap go gos song least good old come eileen british s talking 
oh well 
 anyway direction pretty good although nothing amazing 
branaghs forte really making shakespeare fresh magical least hes good making less ambiguous film like 
 writing good rita rudner martin bregman lots good oneliners even really bad good puns mock fact andrew lives l peter cutting logs asks wood l andrew says hollywood punishment like 
 actors speaking movies better material though standout performances six friends well outsiders like slattery rudner phyllida law old housekeeper peters mansion 
 little note made hugh lauries performance looks like took massive doses prozac mean ive never seen actually act dramatically 
 peters friends really enjoyable film makes people like pine sort future reunion although dont know kind ill like people dont look forward high school reunion 
 way friends still able maintain amount care one another long period seperation just look forward day can friends like
