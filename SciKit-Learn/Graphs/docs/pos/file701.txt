let start saying leading release latest bond film really wasnt looking forward much previous films 
im sure fairly lackluster trailers everpresent dread next film will fall back miserable ways timothy dalton years 
im happy report doubts erased first minutes film 
 point evident mr bond back vengeance 
 doubts probably erased sooner except fact first ten minutes film werent exactly pleasant experience 
 seems nobody told geniuses working theater house lights supposed turned movie starts 
 took reminder audience member clue 
 guess can excused though taking tickets cleaning popcorn shows extremely taxing brain 
anyway somebody remembered light switch settled bond 
 think noticeable aspect th film series really goes back almost tongue cheek style roger moore films 
 probably oneliners movie last several combined 
 bonds last oneliner film best series 
 world enough also contained perhaps action movie series 
everything wild boat chases usual assortment cool bond gadgets trotted just seems way 
 part action sequences worked well 
although couple times thought things bit top even bond film 
 think blame can laid feet director michael apted 
 good job part points movie specifically action sequences seemed loose site fact making essentially action film 
 noticeably sequences snow covered mountain one involving bond getting closing door looked like apted thought filming sort high brow art movie 
 almost seemed like didnt know 
 brief scenes really shouldnt take away otherwise solid job apted directing 
 ever seen bond film wont shocked learn plot never strong suit 
 world enough exception 
 time yet another villain bond stop good world 
 matches wits terrorist renard robert carlyle man bullet lodged brain makes impervious pain 
 point included beyond 
 took great pains explain condition came later movie scene can described looking like afterthought 
anyway renard like typical terrorist bent harebrained scheme involving mideast oil pipeline 
 guess world domination just isnt attractive terrorists money making venture anymore 
bond brought protect pipelines owner elektra king sophie marceau daughter one renards recent victims 
along way bond enlist help nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle 
like bond films basically just suspend disbelief plot since ridiculous beyond words 
 biggest complaint disjointed bond films 
 least one point stop try remember bond 
 buddy saw movie completely confused earlier kidnapping marceaus character 
 alluded earlier movie briefly although included film 
later became big part story left distinct feeling missed something 
 bond film beautiful women nifty gadgets seem make forget script problems quite quickly 
 isnt shakespeare 
 cast 
brosnan seems get better appearances 
 grew roger moore version bond really enjoyed lighter style brosnan brings character 
judi dench m bigger role film two previous appearances role 
 brought talent one expect oscar winner 
robbie coltrane easily one best parts goldeneye nice see russian mobster character revived movie 
coltrane gets screen time simply leads stealing even scenes 
 bond girls 
sophie marceau might one beautiful actresses working today 
 just something breathtaking eyes makes natural play innocent victim 
 saw braveheart know just pretty face 
marceau may talented actress ever play bond love interest 
 denise richards 
 doubt mind cast exclusively looks 
 see outfits wears wont trouble guessing part anatomy caught producers eyes 
 pleasantly surprised find really good job playing nuclear scientist 
admittedly one point audience snickered bit one technical lines dialogue stacks pun intended bond girl predecessors nicely 
 must say biggest disappointment robert carlyles character 
 carlyle fine job material character just never worked 
 producers tried hard add complexity character just never quite got ground 
 guess hoping bit regarding whole impervious pain aspect character writers decided play emotional side character 
 might worked well another movie dont go see bond movies deep characterizations 
last least desmond llewelyn q th appearance llewelyn bonds gadget guy good ever 
although screen time grown far limited past films still treat watch 
rumors abound may last appearance role 
 says future appearances higher power 
 producers introduced protege future replacement bumbling somewhat pompous character played comedy master john cleese 
 dont see much film think fair say desmond llewelyns legacy whenever passed will capable hands 
 stack 
despite problems world enough entertaining movie 
 things considered problems small compared plagued earlier bond movies 
 easily best brosnan films 
 may even best entire series certainly top 
one thing sure even movies still plenty life left james bond series 
heres looking forward bond number
