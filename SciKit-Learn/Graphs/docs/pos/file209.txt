 main problem quickly forgettable cant remember one truly good scene 
 con air scene desert digging plane dirt 
 spawn living room hell conclusion end 
 event horizon video event horizon crew taken hells forces 
 faceoff pretty dang good 
 men black scene still recall will smith squishing giant roaches 
 remember humor hate roaches passion pretty disgusted

back men black just sound funny 
 remember first hearing men black back comic geek th grade read magazines like wizard etc arent comicgeeks wizard basically comics car driver cars new yorker high society boys life boy scots
