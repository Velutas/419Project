one best movies ive ever seen 
id heard extremely good things movie though previews didnt really intrigue much movie id anticipating months now 
 reason im sure movie big sucess u s definite hit critics didnt exactly set box office records 
 viewing incredibly well directed written acted movie cant help wonder 
 strength film gritty realism 
 main characters human individual flaws stereotype hollywood heroes 
 may agree many actions movie approach life makes real 
 expected movie drama thriller mistaken 
even interrogation scenes moved pace felt just thrilling car chase 
 ending whoa 
ive never seen movie life everyone acts brilliantly 
 three male leads guy pearce kevin spacey russell crowe just terrific 
 best actor oscar talk surrounding film netted one statue one problem 
 chosen three actors 
 way look film say one better two 
 impossible 
kim bassingers performance also revelation 
id never big fan always thought well whats word twinky 
 impression changed complemented crowe pearce perfectly 
 depth story characters truly astounding 
 cardboard characters 
 plot full twists turns clever sequences 
pearces interogation three seperate suspects nothing short brilliant 
 really cant fault movie 
 glad see fellow australians pearce crowe star breathtaking movie 
 familiar russell crowe beforehand many australian films seen much guy pearce
