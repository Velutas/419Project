expectation rating bit worse expected mainly found middle part bit dull 
roger ebert gave four star review critic uses full scale often agree dark city best film must seen better film 
 read book five years ago hugely enjoyed 
 opening simple plan reminded bit sweet hereafter 
 landscape snowy cold filmed feel rather crisp manner also reminds fargo loathed 
one can almost sense cold 
 movie far eye popping delights quick dead instead raimi made constrained film probably better 
 probably movie improved lots odd shots 
 movie also reminded affliction lead characters seem hoping seeing possibility lead better life father see chance dream come true 
 chance uncovered snow covered field airplane crash landed 
 plane three men find american dream 
 gym bag 
affliction set snowy landscape 
 really seems simple 
just hold money spring one claims theyll safe spend hope experiencing american dream can come true 
 snow melts might several characters hopes 
 return paradise characters presented chance right thing 
 right thing might result better result something selfish 
 movies biggest strength fact makes sense 
 seen many movies based books just seem like selected scenes book visualized eschewing anything remotely resembling coherent story example clear present danger 
 biggest problem seems overfamiliarization story 
 writer perhaps feels doesnt present scenes clear lack baffles audience read book 
 definitely problem simple plan even though screenplay books author 
 movie always clear going always makes sense 
im sue lot cut really cant remember 
even minor scene involving man complaining paid much grains included 
 man comes mondays claims charged one purchase many 
turns 
well see movie 
one warned seeing trailer 
 reveals several scenes ending moments yes like book downer several plot developments much beginning 
 much spelled directly trailer youre lucky youll forgotten see movie
