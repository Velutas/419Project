 good natured pleasent easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters plays grumpy weatherman phil conners every year sent punxsutawney p report groundhog day 
 groundhog day ceremony involves groundhog lifted box dosent see shadow will early spring 
phil really hates ceremony even producer rita macdowell can change mind 
however fate cruel trick phil starts reliving groundhog day gradually likes rita falls love 
groundhog day well written totatly unoffensive funny comedy 
 screenwriters director ramis danny rubin written funny warm never overly senitmental comedy 
although idea day repeating may sound tedious enough good jokes hold audiences attention throughout whole film 
ramiss direction also helps although dosent try flash director tricks film directed well enough jokes set well 
 editing also good especially shows one part day phil tries perfect night rita 
 performances also excellent 
bill murray great fun transistion cynical happy smooth delivers lines usual smary style 
andie macdowell good rita although sometimes just little bit sweet parts film 
 chemistry two leads thankfully otherwise whole film probably fall part 
chris elliot cameraman larry also funny although like goofy style otherwise really going hate throughout film will lower enjoyment film overall 
 supporting cast arent bad either stephen tobolowsky hillarous phils old school mate ned ryanson even director ramis popping neurologist 
 fact one dud performance film even groundhog gets funny scene involving car chase 
overall really nothing wrong groundhog day 
 almost seems perfect 
however film can get bit soppy sometimes people may get irritated day repeating 
also theres much music score music pretty bad 
 criticisms hardly affect audiences enjoyment 
overall groundhog day funny smart also room heart 
 excellent comedy 
overall rating
