maybe important thing movie handled like hallmark hall fame movie month well manipulative tearjerker broadcasted abc monday night starring kelly martin yasmeen bleeth respectively 
 handled like greatest story ever told precisely great 
underneath todiefor cinematography brilliant acting incessantly wonderful direction film modesty sure whether story totally great balls run tell certain original way 
 doesnt merely go plot point plot point 
 goes character character 
 obsesses depth style makes story worldreknowned cellist contracts ms dies prematurely story two sisters musicians totally unique relationship 
 relationship center story makes film transcend cornball shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities makes unlike patch adams effortlessly emotional real 
 short movie just awesome 
 merely tells story really well thats something just commended days stories botched theyre told great storytellers 
director anand tucker tells story well 
 overdramaticizes everything still keeps real 
 film tells story hilary jacqueline du pr rachel griffiths emily watson respectively two sisters first seen childhood played auriol evans keely flanders respectively best friends 
 also musicians hilary flutist jackie cellist begins considered child prodigies hilary seen better two 
jackie bit jealous works works playing skills soon tables turned 
 hit adulthood hilary strives comeback sister playing famous halls around world instead fame captures heart hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey semistarmaking turn 
 marry short courtship move lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since cello playing becomes symbol current life plays eyes world stops shes alone 
 enters shallow relationship equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain hopes may overcloud sister eventually begins lose runs away hilarys country home hopes gain admittance hilary sleep husband since one sleeps gives pleasure 
 terribly melodramtic can see time jackie contracted ms brilliantly edited scene surpasses breakdown scene semismiliar shine technical emotional devastation time easily call sign melodramatic overload hadnt handled way 
 key thing gradual death slip insanity rather tumultuous relationship sister might add perfectly realized 
 relationship downtoearth complex entity year love eachother anyone else entire world theyre also completely jealous one another 
 young jackie surpasses playing abilities tries vain make comeback cant almost seems marry get back jackie success 
 jackie lands top sees sister marry wonderful man jealous lifestyle extensive brinks ive ever seen film two sisters truly love eachother dare share man 
 whole time love eachother never doubted even tested 
another thing really liked emily watsons performance 
 usually make note never overpraise actor playing either drunkard lunatic someone mortal disease combination three 
 reasoning fucking easy job 
 worst case year may thandie newton beloved sure shes good whats tough playing woman stumbles around slurs words together acts like three year old inside year olds body 
hell play pair breasts 
 exact movie though performance kimberly elise rock holds family together mother slowly goes insane brothers run never seen mothers lover scared 
 actually deal real emotions something much harder mere stumbling 
 academy arts sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons 
 dont believe look jack nicholsons performance good gets great performance easy job 
 isnt watson though insanity comes real emotions just plot point 
 thanks opening sequence see hilary kids understand motives behind actions time actually contracts ms begins loose sanity life weve already understood last straw woman plagued terrible neuroses 
rachel griffiths otherwise understudy watsons protagonist actually matches watson stepforstep watson grows insane demands unspeakable things griffiths holds deal able give sister needs emotional help 
griffiths otherwise unknown actress watson famous breaking waves boxer absolutely brilliant just absolutely brilliant watson academy critics groups whove already deemed watsons performance best year glance shes one doesnt get go insane read gets boring role scream hysteria hear will 
 griffiths thankless job keeping things real tom cruise role rainman one gotten oscar consideration hoffman 
 anyone deserves accolades academy year griffiths 
together two actresses work extremely well though go deep emotional hell likes havent seen year 
 hadnt otherwise nottotallygreat final section deals way much jackie enough hilary two gotten equal treatment entirety id say one top ten best films year 
 close perfection structure treatment subject beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without shred doubt mind maybe film editing nearly shame flawless gem 
 hey can hardly complain
