 rather strange two computer animated talking ant movies come single year disney pixar animation s latest film represents 
 bugs life isnt nearly deep predecessor dreamworks antz just funny 
 bugs life centers appropriately around life ant named flik 
flik cutely voiced newsradios david foley hates sticking tradition attempts find new ways harvesting food task 
 one inventions causes offering completely lost leaders colony send mission get way 
 offering food vile group grasshoppers force ants harvest 
 leader grasshoppers hopper fiendishly voiced oscar winner kevin spacey 
 offering lost hopper upset vows return shortly retrieve double amount food 
 leaders ant colony send flik mission never dream will successful just hope can get way can harvest extra food 
fliks mission hire warrior bugs fight grasshoppers return 
instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs mistakenly assumes warriors 
 returns warriors town ecstatic find truth heroes 
 bugs life animation simply stunning 
 sheer uniqueness day day bug life imaginative 
together great voice acting film perfect holiday family film 
 main weakness couldnt beat antz theaters making seem like stale material
