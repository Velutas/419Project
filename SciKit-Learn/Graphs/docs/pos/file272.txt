corey haim stars lucas bligh tiny year old scruffy hair thick glasses interest insects outdoor life 
one day stops tennis courts sees must angel 
 name maggie year old certainly beauty lovely red hair sweet innocent complexion 
maggie seems little disturbed little kid watching somehow interests soon talking getting know one another 
 gradually become good friends spend summer together various things studying insects namely locusts come hiding every years playing tennis listening symphony orchestra manhole cover 
lucas obviously love maggie charmed clear never consider anything good friend 
 clear lucas however 
 still beleives maggie soulmate dreads impending start school knows whats happen 
 soon find painful scene lucas humiliated jocks pep rally 
 throw stage right front beloved maggie 
surprisingly turns tables jocks clowning around takes far embarassed front entire school 
 next scene brilliant

lucas finally figures whats going tries pick maggie dance 
 causes take severe actions prove maggie try football team 
 last third film revolves around attempt 
 idea seems cliched way executed 
 many surprises last half hour lead ending emotionally involving make heartless cynics get choked 
dave grusins memorable score played perfect moments certainly helps 
lucas filled great performances 
forget everything know corey haim 
back talent proven delivers perfect fully dimensional performance filled anger humor pain 
kerri green appealing maggie showing us cares lucas much attracted 
sheens cappie almost good true sheen makes beleivable especially explains reason protects lucas
