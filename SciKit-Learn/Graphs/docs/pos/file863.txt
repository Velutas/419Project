 uses personal gain time still feel intimate connection 
scarlett continues use manipulative powers men get wants rhett cant help want every time tries oneup marrying another man taking business 
 say opposites attract conflict rhett scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities borders magnetic polarization 
 need know yet never seem truly happy together
