shakespeare hardly understood high school 
 want now english grade doesnt count 
 attitude ill say right bat kenneth branaghs hamlet probably might well stop reading right now 
 however lover bard least openminded challenging script read something rotten state denmark 
namely king died widow queen wed kings brother claudius prince hamlet suspects foul play 
 suspicions confirmed ghost father appears relates story murder brothers hands 
hamlet enlisting help friend horatio conspires capture conscience new king expose treachery 
 game afoot 
 first things notice production sets costumes 
 external scenes filmed blemheim palace england also one sites recent avengers grandiose quality setting immediately established 
interior scenes similarly graced intricate flamboyant rooms chambers 
 hamlet castles grand throne room impressive piece work incorporating high ceilings mirrorpanel doors bridges connect opposite sides secondstory loft 
costuming equally grand drawing upon history imagination 
 quite denmark s characters attire something cross era turn century russia effectively giving film timeless feel 
 surprising tim harvey alexandra byrne nominated best art direction best costume design oscars respectively 
 addition directing kenneth branagh also plays title character 
 revengedriven royal heir branagh provides riveting performance emotional highs lows 
 anticipation seeing fathers ghost melancholy finding burial site childhood jester eventual wrath branagh delivers spades 
every scene truly revolves around hamlet much tribute branaghs acting directing shakespeares manuscript 
hamlet seems whos shakespeareantrained actors watching perform craft much love delight 
julie christie hamlets mother gertrude derek jacobi murderous uncle claudius fill classic roles superbly many supporting players 
kate winslet hamlets lover ophelia outstanding job demonstrating characters plummet depths dispair madness 
richard briers ophelias father polonius michael moloney brother laertes equally convincing 
nicholas farrell hamlets trusted friend horatio timothy spall reece dinsdale twotiming rosencrantz guildenstern round excellent core cast 
hamlet also seems film someone tried stuff many well known actors possible 
 cases made interesting scenes 
billy crystal surprisingly good gravedigger unearths skull yorick hamlet knew quite well 
crystal proves able deliver lines timing classic actor verbal countenance comedian result funny scene 
however charleton heston many might think butcher shakespeare biggest surprise 
 player king leader troupe traveling actors absolutely breathtaking narrating story priam hecuba 
part monologue overlaid visual enactment story sir john gielgud judi dench unfortunate robs heston attention deserves time 
 offcamera speaking gripping sort downplays scene narration done wellvoiced actor 
 wish branagh chosen allow us envision minds scene heston lays let venerable actor attention 
unfortunately casting choices led poor distractions 
jack lemmon excellent actor just cant shakespeare 
 marcellus guard sees elder hamlets ghost lemmon sadly underperforms shown left right around 
gerard depardieu another talented actor wasted given little utterances yes lord lord role reynaldo 
richard attenborough literally walkon role showing eleventh hour english ambassador 
 think two lines 
 rufus sewell fortinbras norway 
 went see dangerous beauty earlier year two ladies behind kept commenting handsome 
 bulging eyes idea handsome well guess comic actor marty feldman kind sex symbol 
hamlet complicated tale treachery revenge triumph defeat become one 
branagh attempts help us intricacies visually representing elusive stretches dialogue presenting flashbacktype images 
 works half time wonder just well without 
 dont kind genius appreciate shakespeare quite difficult understand unless time read hear carefully repeatedly 
 alternate method comprehension us familiar high school english course 
 hopefully fortunate enough educator willing help plot points nuances essential understanding play written rigmarole known kings english 
 suppose just read cliff notes
