 acrimony dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg disney big wheel michael eisner well known 
 years two companies tried sabotage others film video releases issuing similar competing productions day 
 now katzenberg using entire movie attack former employer 
heres suggestion two boys grow 
put past behind 
theres room sandbox farquaads cant play nice go rooms 
 area found troubling came portrayal lord farquaad 
beyond irreverence shrek actually message people learn look beyond physical appearances true beauty lies within 
 lovely notion film betrays moral incessantly taking cheap shots farquaads diminutive stature 
 really need family film reinforcing idea mocking short people acceptable 
 pompous selfish behavior farquaad enough make target zingers 
adding short jokes simply mean 
still shrek rollicking good time 
 computer animation mostly impressive although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys human movements often jerky voice work strong particularly eddie murphy laughs come fast furious moral tainted though may good one 
 trot clich shrek fun ages 
parents though remind young ones ride home taunting others short tall skinny fat etc bad thing
