 movie one first american films done director paul verhoeven 
 done films since basic instict starship troopers 
 movies one main thing common dont skimp violence 
 verhoeven movie guy doesnt get shot chest gets shot many times body 
robocop takes place detroit future 
things pretty bleak 
 company ocp rules city iron fist moving running police force 
peter weller plays cop goes mission partner nancy allen 
peter weller goes empty room alone gets killed 
meanwhile ocp failed demonstration ed model robot crime fighter 
someone comes idea cyborg robocop use parts worth scalvaging peter weller make robocop movie titled 
 plot movie generally runs decent pace 
 drags bit towards end robocop wanting finish everybody plot twists keep exciting 
 acting bad weller human good robocop 
nancy allen decent job 
 movie doesnt leave open sequel exactly 
 made one anyway 
enter 
robocop starring peter weller nancy allen directed irvin kershner 
detroit bleak state first film 
ocp trying develop improved robocop will match criminals

 film pretty bizaare 
 yearold druglord curses much eddie murphy even violence original humor 
 plot movie pretty large almost much 
 three four plot lines weaving around dont really match
