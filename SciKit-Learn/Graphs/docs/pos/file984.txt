 films divided critical consensus sharply alan parkers adaptation frank mccourts memoir angelas ashes 
many dismissed humorless sentimentalized uninteresting version hugely popular novel others hailed heartfelt sincere portrait human spirit 
im somewhere leaning strongly towards latter 
 certainly wellmade never becomes tedious like literary adaptations tendency 
 feeling parker filled movie pseudolyrical shots rain falling homely streets ireland just can twoandahalf hour running time screams im important 
mccourts book name family moving us ireland early s time people desperately trying get us

 story 
director alan parker commitments knows tell good story angelas ashes despite relentlessly literary tone remains interesting 
though film occasionally indulges much gloomily picturesque irish setting avoids looking like glorified travelogue 
supplementing parkers able direction engaging often poignant performances leads seasoned thespians others relative beginners 
carlyle charismatic british actor shown astonishing range hopping lead rowdy slapstick comedy villain james bond movie now sentimental melodrama perfectly portrays rather pathetic character 
 empathize guy dont like admire 
emily watson turns heartfelt sincere supporting performance 
 mostly implants lump throats 
also worthy mention little joe breen whose face graces films superb poster 
 breens first feature film hes extraordinary young frank 
 unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment sixth sense can peer characters soul breens sad eyes 
 flip side one thing vastly improved angelas ashes decisive editor 
 gerry hambling sure makes scenery parker also leave least half hour unnecessary footage 
 first half especially trimmed bringing film reasonable running time bladders favor process 
things pick halfway point sort dismissing lot criticisms accumulated opening hour maintain aggressively deliberate pace parker co set first half ludicrously unnecessary 
 spoiler warning 
skip next paragraph suspense 
 films final message somewhat conflicted frankie effect leaves family famished ireland goes back america 
 exactly supposed make 
 mother doesnt seem mind wants best possible future son mother still seems inconsiderate 
 havent read book im sure mccourt justifies actions therein therefore im suspicious 
another thing thats never made clear movie meaning title im sure also explained memoir 
 seen film onto rather adaptation angelas ashes stands tall 
despite minor setbacks captivating story people forced live trenches merciless society weaker character shoved bottom financial ladder
