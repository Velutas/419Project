 booming introduction music finishes camera sweeps red mountains 
 see two figures looking barren red landscape 
 kiss walk 
one characters schwarzenegger slips falls 
 glass mask cracks 
 face scruches eyes begin pop 
 doug quaid played schwarzenegger wakes 
 dream 
 wakes next beautiful wife played stone film begins 
total recall typical scifi film wrapped around intresting far fetched plot 
quaid never mars keeps dreams planet now colanised 
one day riding train hes sees ad company called rekall implants memories holiday instead actually going 
quaid chooses secret agent mars memory s really hits fan 
 implant goes wrong quaid really thinks agent mars two minutes goes back normal cant remember thing 
however everyone knows workmates wife turn saying blabbed mars blew cover mission strange man called richter played ironside wants kill 
quaid now hopelessly confused follows advice given friend 
 gets ass mars 
mars ruled cohagen played cox charges people air 
 rebels mainly mutants 
 rebels need quaid defeat cohagen quaid knows cant remember yet reactor produces air 
eventually quaid kills cohagen turns reactor saves planet goes away beautiful girl just like guy rekall promised 
throughout plot huge explosions thousands deaths mean lot death swearing sex everything else makes good verhoeven director basic instinct starship troopers movie 
naturally theres pretty imaginative deaths arms getting ripped someone getting drilled heads exploding 
 can tell violent stuff 
 done stylishly course arnie tones one liner thats excusable 
 acting variable 
arnie course useless goes good lines first twenty minutes even acts like normal bloke like action hero 
stone course useless making pretty poor wife pretty poor action hero 
 sex scenes alright 
ticoton recently seen con air ok good action getting emotions wrong 
one minute hates quaid next loves never gets tranisition right 
 good guys awful 
 bad guys excellent 
cox basically reprising robocop hes still great delivers best line whole film near end 
ironside superbly evil utterly emotionless face 
 supporting cast fine even comedy sidekick time form taxi driver annoying 
one disappointing aspect though special effects 
ilm dreamquest good work subway station scene model work good 
 model heads look appaling fake quatto major disappointment 
another irritating thing product placement 
 lot plugs good mars today gag however sets look great special effects end film arent bad either 
theres also good soundtrack running jerry goldsmith omen poltergeist star trek motion picture 
overall total recall hugely violent yet hugely enjoyable action fest reasonable plot thrown great bad guys imaganitive death 
 schwarzenegger movie bad 
 fact good
