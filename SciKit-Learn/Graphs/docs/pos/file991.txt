 surreal situations ordinary everyday life viewed outsider 
 observers joel ethan coen surreal becomes bizarre 
 life jeff dude leboswki bizarre falls edge world whatsgoingonaroundhere 
 marvelous sound stranger sam elliot s voiceover introduces film 
 least forgets going say gives 
 dude jeff bridges described laziest man los angeles possibly world although hes much slothful relaxed 
spending last years roach clip one hand white russian doesnt much life hes good time 
 asked fun responds bowl drive around occasional acid flashback 
lebowskis passion bowling

 carpet important pulls room together surprisingly since virtually object 
 hes denied money picks replacement rug floor 
 way runs lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny tara reid offers perform sexual act according rumor one bill clintons favorites thousand bucks 
 penniless dude wisecracks hes heading cash machine 
later gets unexpected phone call enlisting aid bag man deliver ransom bunnys kidnappers 
 begins trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences 
 kidnappers impossibly inept 
 dude cronies even worse 
every plan goes awry 
 can almost see lebowskis brain churning slow motion tries figure clues 
thats story tell truth doesnt much matter 
 almost plot film just entertaining 
 narrative exists can watch offbeat characters quirky predicaments fall 
 dudes bowling buddies walter john goodman donny steve buscemi look like people youd see street like everything else film theyre quite seem 
walter vet stuck vietnam dude sixties 
everything happens reminds situation nam 
 fellow bowler crosses foul line wont admit walter pulls gun marks zero score sheet 
donny gets precious words walters screaming dudes rambling 
 walter shouts horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns 
donny league doesnt frame reference 
 film peppered people term character understatement 
 big lebowskis daughter maude avantgarde vaginal artist paints swinging naked leather apparatus like sm mary martin 
 kidnappers german techno nihilist bikers 
bunny lebowski high school cheerleader turned porno star 
 impressive john turturro far small role hispanic bowler 
 flamenco music swells see putting lavender hose 
 camera pans allpurple skintight bowling outfit jesus pronounced j h embroidered pocket 
 addresses lane intense seriousness one painted fingernail 
 tongue slowly snakes lovingly licks glowing bowling ball 
bridges works dude living decades maybe 
 cant think anyone else done better job 
buscemi limited role plays perfectly 
 see john goodman convinced hes one treasures time 
 odd think world knows roseanne barrs television husband 
 like coens raising arizona hit fargo big lebowski demands open mind even open eyes 
 mark coen brothers even wonderful dream sequences broad slapstick physical comedy screen much humor subtle easy miss 
theres much going frequently disappears can see 
walking theater felt film something important say 
 examination wasnt sure exactly 
 meet jesus bowling alley going expect 
 going gets weird weird go bowling 
maybe theres real message 
perhaps just roller coaster ride hilarious world 
maybe thats enough
