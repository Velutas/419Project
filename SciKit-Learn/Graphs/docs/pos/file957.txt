uncompromising french director robert bressons lancelot lake achieves exact opposite effect sir thomas malorys morte darthur 
instead enshrining legend king arthur knights round table dethrones revealing arthur weak ineffectual leader knights group jealous bickering men failed live legends prescribed 
chivalry place lancelot lake except dying ideal 
bresson begins tale knights round table returning decimated failing merlins command retrieve holy grail mystical cup filled christs blood 
bresson immediately gives us impression essential meaning grail quest bloodshed failure 
 opening sequence series clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights head hacked stomach impaled skull split open skeletal remains hang trees burning bodies smolder ruins flaming house 
since film starts camelot nearruin takes hour half arrive inevitable conclusion doesnt carry grand tragic resonance arthurian films 
 never get see camelot peak power therefore real downfall witness 
 name camelot evoked title film 
rather lancelot bresson interested internal battle within heart external downfall kingdom 
lancelot always tragic figure arthurian tales bresson uses central figure explore battle spirit flesh 
 greatest knights flawed love arthurs wife queen guinevere illicit affair eventually caused downfall camelot 
even lancelot attempts end affair guinevere laura duke condominas finds falling back arms better judgment 
 knows means destruction idealized kingdom powerless passion 
 sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot affair knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring lancelots defense 
 battle within knights eventual undoing round table flesh wins spirit consequences dire 
bresson intensely personal filmmaker interested interiors mens hearts minds 
 lancelot lake filled particular trademarks strippeddown minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue grand use natural sounds place music 
 uses background music twice film opening narration segment opening credits 
 music heavy drumbeat accompanying bagpipes rest film scored natural sounds punctuate films thematic elements incessant clanking creaking heavy armor neighing horses rhythm hooves beating dirt roads natural chirping whispering forest 
like films bresson employed nonprofessional actors recite dialogue emotionless flat voices 
 actors used lancelot lake never acted exception patrick bernhard never acted 
never raise voices put emphasis given word 
instead using vocal inflection bresson strove create emotion images 
 ways technique works ways doesnt 
 final montage arthurs men battling quite marvelous final image knights shining armor reduced literal scrappile sums entire film one moment 
however times bressons uncompromising methods distracting questionable 
 instance important jousting contest bresson films majority action things visible horses legs 
 repeatedly opening shot notes bagpipe raising different flag 
 might symbolic value resulting experience watching can bothersome 
nevertheless lancelot lake fascinating cinematic experience boldly made master filmmaker 
bressons style may everyone one respect strength artist 
 reevaluating arthurian legends making turns lancelot lake something rare modern cinema truly personal film
