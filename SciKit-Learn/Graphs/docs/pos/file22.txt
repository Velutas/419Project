one can observe star trek movie expect see serious science fiction 
 purpose star trek provide flashy innocent fun 
sometimes stories compelling 
sometimes theyre 
 exception first film series provides little endless shots amazed faces ive never bored enterprises numerous missions 
star trek insurrection exception 
 film gotten negative reviews friend mine actually thinks worst series im really sure 
 exciting often hilarious movie engaged left ready next star trek film 
 say bit light long episode film 
others say special effects cheesy boring 
 simply enjoyed film 
insurrection second film feature strictly next generation cast introduces us race people called baku baku old three hundred years old actually appear younger age due strange radiation rings planet 
 course peaceful people cant horde fountain youth leave archenemies sona led ruafo f 
murray abraham mess everything 
 sona horribly disfigured rely daily reconstructive surgery aesthetically acceptable strike deal federation move baku elsewhere exploit secret keep race dying 
thats captain picard patrick stewart steps realizes moving baku kill also helps falls love baku woman donna murphy 
 trusty crew picard defies federation keep baku natural habitat 
 dealing series much history entirely necessary reintroduce characters episode 
 believe nonfans hard time getting star trek order enjoy one understand approach 
insurrection however surprisingly good job us new aspects characters 
stewart bold always magnetic screen presence perfectly capable holding entire film together 
jonathan frakes also directed funny commander riker subplot data brent spiner discovering lost childhood fairly interesting abraham makes perfect star trek villain overacting like crazy 
frakes showed similar aptitude direction first contact insurrection exciting film really attractive special effects lot good action 
 apparently first star trek film utilize computer animation result pleasing eye particularly climactic scenes sona employ giant space ship suck rings baku planet special effects clean impressively sharp look 
 complaint film tries take moral stance appropriate 
 dont think big deal federation wanted move baku order save lives thousands 
better yet couldnt coexisted 
insurrection feels little light spring kinds big moral questions audience 
 inherent camp factor star trek series doesnt seem wellequipped deal issues like 
 prefer just enjoy spectacle
