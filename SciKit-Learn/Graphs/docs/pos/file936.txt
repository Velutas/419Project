 initially set review film tag line going can believe whales can fly 
 going can believe pastel triangles can fly 
 going can believe wood sprites can fly 
finally just gave trying come tag line decided say 
theres lot flying going film 
 first host steve martin tells us original concept behind fantasia bring every year old segments retained new segments added 
well apparently plan fell wayside approximately sixty years passed since original classic released 
part might something cold reception film got first released grossing somewhere close original month release 
subsequent rereleases film elevated popularity film classic status finally achieved rightfully deserved 
 celebrate release updated version fantasia disney imax teamed present animated film fashion one seen six stories high 
 exclusive four month engagement january st april th fantasia can seen many imax theaters across us 
 engagement film will shown regular theaters 
 format effective film 
 exceptions yes 
 first segment presented set beethovens fifth symphony 
 hard describe exactly segment involves bunch brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting happily 
everything seems going great little things ground erupts swarms evil black batlike triangles attack engulf lighter counterparts 
eventually shafts light help drive away evil batlike things peace returns butterfly things 
though segment isnt story driven images visually strong especially scene dark cloud bat things outlined blood red colors begin overtake skies 
 next segment set ottorino respighis pines rome 
 segment humpback whales swim happily ocean eventually emerge water fly around massive icebergs pepper oceanscape 
 whale calf gets scuffle nearby birds flight ends getting trapped giant iceberg smashes trying avoid birds attack 
 finally saved another liberating shaft light brethren take skies fly upper atmosphere frolic oceans clouds 
 visuals key segment especially whales involved 
reportedly whales viewed imax screen certain sequences shown actual size 
 cgi whales look incredibly lifelike except googly cartoon eyes drawn onto images 
one especially striking image involves giant shadow one whales cast wall iceberg whale calf tries find way parent 
absolutely beautiful stuff 
 third segment least eight segments set george gershwins rhapsody blue 
 segment designed tribute acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld intertwines four different stories sad souls living depression era new york 
theres construction worker dreams jazz drummer outofwork sad sack dreams job young girl dreams spending time parents instead hustled schoolmarm nebbish dreams free overbearing wife 
 wont go everything works fine disney tradition happy ending 
unfortunately story drags quite bit seems place within hyper reality rest segments 
segment four set dmitri shostakovichs piano concerto animated version hans christian andersens steadfast tin soldier 
 one legged toy tin soldier falls love windup clock ballerina assumes also one legged cant see leg extended behind much dismay evil jackinthebox jester 
 jester knocks soldier window continues pursuing ballerina 
little jester know soldier deposited sewer journeyed pipelines swallowed fish captured sold owner set tin soldiers one legged one comes 
 soldier eventually saves day gets girl 
although ending altered andersen story steadfast tin soldier decently told framework seven minute short 
 children may find jester little frightening otherwise segment well made 
segment five funniest bunch 
set camille saintsaens carnival animals segment features flamingo torturing fellow flamingos yoyo trying perform choreographed dance number 
 shortest clip group throwback alligators hippos dancing first fantasia still well accomplished welcome bit comedy 
segment six segment repeated original fantasia one people remember sorcerers apprentice 
 story recognizable draw seeing enormous imax screen remastered stereo 
unfortunately segment wasnt made presented large format film considering shot full frame exhibits large amounts grain 
 least two occasions images hard make due excessive grain 
similar problems crop modern day releases projected screens large image shown accurately one seems notice strange reason anomaly common many plus screen theaters 
segment seven set sir edward elgars pomp circumstance march fantasia segment feature stock disney character 
donald duck stars assistant noah whose task loading animals onto ark 
 loading donald wife lose sight believe one didnt make boat 
 constantly missing due comic misadventures mainly involving donald crushed animals various manners 
despite slapstick style comedy piece displays emotion final scene many tearjerkers foisted audiences days 
powerful stuff 
segment eight brings whole new meaning clich saving best last 
set igor stravinskys firebird elk awakens forest sprite proceeds change wintery landscape beautiful springtime landscape 
trees bloom flowers blossom everything seems going well sprite becomes inquisitive large mountain housing strange formation 
 sprite examines formation awakens becomes titular firebird 
 stunning spectacle firebird rears back unleashes fire storm destroys everything path including everything sprite worked create 
 amazing animation present well worth ten dollars ticket alone although brush strokes evident one scene due enlargement film 
 host segments largely pun intended throwaways although steve martins clip pretty funny 
 sure stay credits little humor martin 
penn teller usually funny gags seem routine therefore uninteresting 
 best segment comes people bette midler gets tell us abandoned segments never made drawing board 
pieces like flight bumblebee take four horsemen set wagners ride valkyries strange segment prepared s salvador dali never shown previewed teased may appear future installments 
 fans visual stimulation classical music fantasia perfect way spend afternoon 
 film also decent family entertainment contains little objectionable material 
 mentioned earlier review ten dollars seems like much spend film fear run imax theaters going brought regular theaters 
 must stress best way see film imax screen though 
 can believe whalestriangle thingssprites can fly
