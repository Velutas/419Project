oh god many john grisham lawyer films munundated 
 perfect world civil action breath fresh air 
 cynical lawyers way grisham isnt 
 romantic exact opposite way grisham bookfilm isnt 
 capper distinct ending law hollywood films else must ending 
even based true story true story hasnt yet ended must supply ending false one ending nevertheless 
hell civil action even sly witty grisham works put together includes firm novel will ever regarded classic 
yet also oddly slightly unsatisfying 
weird 
 fact steve zallian film just work hack zallian director muchadmired search bobby fischer didnt see writer none schindlers list 
 short like guy sucker way tells stories 
 apart obvious itsaholocaustfilm itsaspielbergfilm isnt schindlers list just damn brilliant film much holocaust film wonderful character study 
 civil action way narrative split lawyer film character study 
 film seems go bit wrong 
 main complaint film yes engrossing lawyerly tale real ending thats necessarily problem film 
 just kind unsatisfying 
 great film feel complete still end basically way 
 film just seems end dont want stupid suggest alternate ending tacked imagine will one film looking forward film discovered truth surrealistic unpleasant hollywood filter just many wont bitch essentially genuine 
 fact just ends actuality wrong 
 rather zallian chosen last half hour adandon traditional lawyer story chose part story one lawyer one jan schlictman john travolta whos shown opening throughout movie heartless brilliant lawyer brilliant hes manipulative always wins 
 wishes make jan end truth change although nicely done full 
 see suffering personal crisis travolta pretty good job depicting change heart end dont fully believe 
 think problem made decision film choses odd angle go noble one one gives films conclusion incompleteness 
 opening film see old schtick manipulating courts winning cases effortlessly discussing heard radio interview great job much cares cases 
 short hes full bullshit know 
 film takes case hardly desired town several children died mysteriously lukemia source illness seems local factory may may dumping waste river 
point one usual criteria jan points wickedly dead wounded children arent nearly sympathetic struck midst success 
point two several lawyers 
 turning jan changes mind muddled scene stops car bridge looks feeling sense overachievement team lawyers tony shalhoub zeljko ivanek accountant william h macy head town battle towns company 
 spend millions dollars examining land test water stephen fry possible oscar nominee brilliant performance wilde pops thanklessly meantime question parents dead children unsuccessfully workers plant 
 also find clashing brilliant lawyer company eccentric jerome facher played robert duvall later 
 progress get involved way story told engulfing everything around including individual brief stories townspeople one best bit james gandolfini employee plant living across street kathleen quinland lost child begins personal crisis 
things begin go downhill lawyers second half impossible odds judge john lithgow strickler pal facher employees plant either afraid loyal testify concrete evidence found depsite money spent find quickly running money 
 macy mortgages everything can including homes office slowly loses sanity meatiest role since oh fargo audience begin feel real loss hope protagonist 
 fact last half hour change rest film unresolved widely panned par owen gleiberman especially criticized film overlydramatic 
suppose like grisham novel 
 wouldnt change jan handled way instead change heart automatically perceived good hes seen still full bullshit 
 doesnt take stock cares partners causes lose money noteriaty lawyer field wants help people town instead seen good nature sure bring 
 final half tries redeem must point making zallians mind follows series scenes merely see making personal stands beliefs though changed considerably opening moments hes seen speeding back forth town wishes employ thusly receiving two speeding tickets still feel big change life hes rich esteemed anymore films final title card witty actuality shallow 
 fault closure court case still going know personal story feels like needs either another chapter another angle final one 
 need feel like character really made big change life story story strife like one town inspire whopping change personal life 
 feels like half 
maybe even less 
 travolta great job though never truly memorable performance rather zallian whose final chapter needs rewrite 
 though engrossing drama one best year fact one best lawyer films period 
 reason recognizes court trial defended prosecuted rather lawyers knights battle eachother 
 learn company almost positively blame deaths town reason cant blamed best prosecution can find 
 duvalls facher brilliant character magnificent job portraying man almost easy overlook subtley great 
facher seen elderly man goofy eccentric carrying broken brown bag stickers eating lunches paper bags making point take time day listen radio scold anyone interupts 
 look deeper see master work evil manipulative nature hidden eccentricities others don upon difficult hell clearly generalize way 
thats liked film hard put pointer 
 can never see exactly film will land even credits roll still arent sure make 
call zallian effect 
 thing happened schindlers list im comparing oskar schindler jan schlictman 
 film greatly crafted cant help get involved broad storytelling interesting characters peculiarly wit comes along 
 felt totally complete like say schindlers list though point may unfair make comparisons two might one best films year along full breath fresh air
