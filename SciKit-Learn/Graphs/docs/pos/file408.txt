 admit disliked film initially 
 certianly isnt every taste sheer torture sit youre restless mood 
 said right mood absolutely incredible 
 second favorite movie shooin first almost year 
perhaps big turnoff many films unconventionality 
id hardpressed compare film ive seen artsy incredibly slow amazingly works beautifully 
 second viewing realized film follows three act structure didnt think sort structure first saw 
 first act serves set characters sort 
 exists even moreso set mood tension restlesness perhaps even feelings boredom 
 shattered intense violence second encompasses movie 
 majority film one extended battle scene intercut brief flashbacks voiceovers 
 artsier elements detract action add succeed briefly letting viewer peek minds soldiers suddenly yanked back reality battle resumes 
 battle scenes amazing second saving private ryan opinion 
theyre brutal horrifying times beautiful due amazing cinematography 
 second act immersive brilliant haunting film ever seen 
 problems come first third acts 
malick takes little long get film started 
although initial scenes consist two soldiers experiencing nearedenlike paradise going awol preperations battle effective necessary hints pretentiousness sink 
 film just tad artsy near beginning lot people disliked movie probably gave 
 final act effective winding film problems first persist bit long comes pretentious times 
 said two sequences one soldier gets devastating note wife another one main characters killed nothing short incredible 
 performances phenominal around 
 two standouts nick nolte newcomer jim caviezel nominated oscars 
nolte riveting intense colonel charge operation 
 character hard mean somewhat reckless lives men yet nolte somehow manages evoke sympathy 
caviezel forever questioning nature war place theres deeper meaning hell hes going 
 absolutely perfect genuine sympathetic sincere yet strong needs 
although restricted relatively small role sean penn also good companys pessimistic seargent 
 stacks saving private ryan second favorite movie ryan first 
 really hard compare two different wont beyond saying spielbergs film impact 
however two comparable standpoint quality can easily see someone thin red line ryan 
 highly recommend consider two best war movies ever made 
 thin red line filmmaking incredibly high order 
 slight faults easily offset sheer brilliance done right 
 real shame tanked box office films unconventional powerful thoughtprovoking dont come along often
