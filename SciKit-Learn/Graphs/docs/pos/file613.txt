 wake smashing success rumble bronx looking likely jackie chan films will see american release 
rumor one films will drunken master ii 
 version copy laserdisc widescreen bilinguallysubtitled hong kong films days 
availability united states limited films must either purchased via pirates sought asian distributors tai seng 
 subtitling copy slightly hard read letters white bit small 
although american release will almost certainly dubbed review subtitled version please keep mind youre reading review help decide whether go see 
 fair must admit ive never fond periodpiece martial arts moviesthe ones set nebulous china distant distant past 
perhaps ive seen filmed inferior stock either butchered dubbing allbutillegible subtitling perhaps plots tend similar many cases nonexistant 
 fact many get wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely minutes end 
 matter might jackie chan films modern settings armour god rumble bronx etc tend spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles large explosions whereas period pieces simply martial arts 
 said must now turn right around say drunken master ii remarkable exception one better martial arts films ive seen quite enjoyed 
surprised 
well 
drunken master ii young man named wong feihong played jackie chan master drunken boxing style kung fu 
 learned style uncertain father wong keiying ti lung steadfast opposition feihongs practicing rather normal style kung fu 
apparently feihong sort figure chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan americans ive heard little quite well wrong ill leave analysis people know better 
one friends points character wong feihong also featured upon time china movies yet seen 
 plot drunken master ii somewhat hazy plots many films youre watching jackie chan film odds arent expecting something order war peace 
 story seems revolve around evil foreigners spiriting away ancient chinese relics hence chinas cultural heritage overworking underpaying beating chinese workers nearby steel mill 
however plot merely serves framework main story filmfeihongs perpetual struggle win girlfriend supplicate father keep pregnant mother played anita mui fighting keep getting beaten evil foreigner thugs 
 macguffin drives plot s precious antique jade imperial seal taken away evil foreigners 
 beginning feihong accidentally steals trying recover identicallywrapped box containing medicinal ginseng father bringing back customer 
 process clashes another thief trying seal ends instead ginseng 
 feihong narrowly avoids getting caught seal evil foreigners lackies thanks timely intervention generals son cameo appearance andy lau later take starring role drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back wong household feihong mother attempt come replacement missing ginseng 
 goes 
 plot thickens later feihongs girlfriend maneuvers kung fu match rival feihong thief now revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover seal stop evil foreigners attacked en masse another grand kungfu movie tradition think ive already spent time plot really deserves 
lets move real draw jackie chan movies 
action 
theres plenty martial arts action found movie 
course kung fu film thats expected 
however isnt just another kung fu movie one jackie chan fight stunt choreography jackie chan genius 
 primary martial arts style featured film drunken boxing form kung fu attempts draw adversary guard making seem like fellow using drunk 
 purposes film least drunken boxers fight better actually intoxicated 
theres fine line just drunk enough drunk stupor 
 normal circumstances idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively even incredibly might seem rather stupid jackie pulls flair 
 kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper ill just say fightsespecially big climactic fight endin make movie worth watching 
another thing drunken master ii going stunt work 
even without motor vehicles well counting train remarkable stunts film 
among things jackie dives balcony table crawls across hot coals least twice count outtake shown credits 
 quicktime movies stunts can found www movie database 
unlike american films stunts faked 
drunken master ii stars several veteran actors hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow anita mui heroic trio series rumble bronx 
 performances firstrate especially comes comedy parts film 
 scene feihong mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back cover missing ginseng root hilarious scene feihongs mother just revealed pregnant threatening hurt order draw husbands anger away feihong 
jackie developed knack physical comedy sort mastery years hes fine form drunken master ii 
 far cinematography concerned certainly works film 
 nothing spectacular least dozen times better old kung fu movies s 
 picture crisp clear 
one thing find particularly worthy mention least copy screen wider film ive ever seen videotape beforealmost whole screen blocked 
 watch bigscreen tv movie theater can 
 will utter shame film eventually panandscanned american video release 
drunken master ii shows full potential period piece kung fu movies good enough overcome even usual distaste movies 
 plot meander bit thats expected type film 
 like kind movie youll love movie well give chance anyway 
 nothing else martial arts stunt sequences worth price admission rental
