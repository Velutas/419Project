 curious thing ive found willis called carry whole movie hes much better movie 
even though sixth sense name doesnt pivotal role 
 honour goes haley osment plays cole sear cute pun seer year old boy can see ghosts 
 osment cute precious director going maudlin nothing movieoftheweek thankfully osment better instances blows everyone else screen bravura performance 
 get see fears vulnerabilities strengths intelligence makes sixth sense one best movies ive seen year 
 whole cast matches quality willis giving fairly low key performance matches subject matter 
one thing movie target 
 isnt sfxfest like haunting gorefest id call supernatural drama interested characters dazzling makeup 
one caveat theres lovely twist movie something like usual suspects end replaying movie head rethinking just seen 
 extremely lucky see sneak preview toronto hype critical reviews went biases 
 anyone want talk movie see dont let 
let director explain pace youll enjoy movie vastly
