one never quite knows one going get mamet film 
 american buffalo setbound piece little plot 
sometimes will tell story really moves 
heist mamet entertaining work 
unlike spanish prisoner lapses credibility 
heist probably best mamet thriller since house games 
 kind plot never sure will doublecross frequently mamet doublecrossing viewer 
watching films team getting around security viewer frequently asking either heck 
 didnt anybody think 
appropriately enough heist opens clever jewelry store job 
 clever one wonders mamet really thinks ideas help professional magician con expert ricky jay now regular actor mamet films 
 robbery works like welloiled machine 
 just one problem enough get joe moore played gene hackman filmed security camera 
now joe get business 
 coming time anyway 
joes team including bobby blane delroy lindo fran moor rebecca pidgeon pinky pincus ricky jay going split go separate ways 
 crime boss bergman danny devito pulling strings says joe people manage one robbery 
 take along young kid short fused jimmy silk sam rockwell 
immediately obvious going meets eye 
much distinguishes heist mamets dialog 
remarkably serves double purpose 
 robbery team sounds professional time mamets special feel dialog 
hackman lines like everybody needs money 
thats call money 
mamets timing perfect direction terrible production 
 plot coincidentally lot like plot recent score fact similar story 
 good films perhaps reasons 
 least high level much story 
 problem timing heist involves airport security clever ways get around 
 saw film toronto international film festival september 
 made subject matter just little timely 
 understanding release will delayed 
 biggest problem film rebecca pidgeons acting times seems poor 
 kind mamet trademark understand women talk without inflection just reading words first time 
 irritation distracts us otherwise good thriller 
 one rate scale high scale
