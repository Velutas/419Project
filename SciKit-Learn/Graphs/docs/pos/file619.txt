director david fincher eye detail rare hollywood days terry gilliam comes mind another one 
film one best art forms can tell story can use camera capture smallest detail mean something 
 directors seem go action slightest ounce story 
 whenever director uses camera fullest potential film almost automatically deserves good review 
 add fascinating story nearly perfect entertainment 
finchers game exception 
 game one interesting complex films come hollywood long time 
fincher hasnt made film since seven box office critical hit defied expectations became one best movies ever 
 time made another film 
 ride 
 game isnt quite powerful seven ways better 
overall game used little clarity little uncertainty 
 walks line insanity reality never goes either way end 
 outcome satisfying enough preceding events makes lot sense everything set straight 
unfortunately unlike usual suspects never given enough information figure happening whether true false 
however also gives film frightening aspect game uses fullest extent 
 game told completely main characters point view 
nicholas van orton michael douglas highstrung isolated businessman 
 lives alone giant mansion divorced wife elizabeth celebrating th birthday age father committed suicide mansion 
 th birthday conrad sean penn rebel family gives nicholas gift certificate crs consumer recreation services 
 will make life fun brother promises 
 skeptical nicholas somewhat intrigued annoyed lack informationsomething businessman hates 
seeing billboard office decides visit mysterious company 
jim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas guides signup process consists psychtests physicals emotional responses mind games 
 game suited persons emotional psychological needs explains feingold 
one day nicholas gets call crs explain failed tests 
even intrigued now somewhat angered time spent signing starts asking around see people can tell company 
 doesnt realize game already begun 
 phone call just first many strange events thrown nicholas way 
 finds involved witnessed amusing fun visually impressive 
 detail involved finchers shots incredible almost requires second viewing just appreciate effort went 
 seven fincher almost every single shot mean something 
 also unique ability make look exactly wants 
compared seven though game light comical 
 films sense humor selfawareness nothing can taken quite seriously 
 dont try make much sense goes game doesnt want 
 make sense final revelationwhen everything becomes apparent clear 
 taken games ending makes complete sense 
 try critique every minute detail get plot holes incredibility 
perhaps reason docked film 
 trying remain realistic plausible plot unbelievable create real tension screen 
 dont really care douglas character lives isnt believable 
 ending requires believed anything happened previously suspend disbelief take film can accept game emotionally psycholically disturbing thriller 
michael douglas gives terrific performance nicholas 
douglas played lonely businessmen adds another level performance 
 character normally levelheaded relies facts forced trust nobody 
can believe waitress bumped 
 brother got involved game first place 
douglas portrays aspect character extremely well gives one best performances even better falling persona 
 supporting cast essential film casting critical 
sean penn always good gives yet another credible performance douglas brother 
deborah kara unger crash waitress bumps performance extremely good 
 fact almost steals film douglas 
james rebhorn portrays character well adds confusion desparation douglas predicament 
another good performance comes armin muellerstahl shine book editor 
 considering douglas every single scene game commands cast makes distant lonely character come colorful life 
 game rated r language violence gore nudity drugs 
 essential film work writing 
john brancato michael ferris woven confusing compelling screenplay witty dialogue funny moments 
 screenplay will probably get oscar nomination best original screenplay almost exactly thing usual suspects 
however visuals game enough make viewer enjoy vexing plot 
 can get believe everything occuring screen will thoroughly entertained one years best films
