seen february home video borrowed chris wessell 
 comes modern gangster movies really difficult describe review without making comparisons films genre andor just using word routine 
ive always subscribed philosophy idea matter many times used can provide good story donnie brasco clinches idea 
 unlike great films genre yet never apes anothers style good layer authenticity even core tad stale 
 film starts typical fashion defining atmosphere new york city late s mobsters inhibit 
 meet lefty pacino aging wiseguy can still walk walk talk talk 
 associates go generic motions expect see crime films like 
somehow comes across donnie brasco depp younger guy lot spunk isnt afraid lefty rep even manages befriend lefty ready kill 
 clear donnie new life lefty recognizes immediately telling tricks trade 
 never seen technique actually revealing mafioso idiosyncrasies done film deserves credit 
however soon realize donnie actually joe pistone fbi agent working undercover character symbolizes viewer will soon purged lifestyle treated newcomer 
 first act works guided ot rhetoric wiseguy honor brief history mob definitions slang money comes goes 
 screenplay rather sketchy details surrounding elements however fact mentioned quite original 
 gangster movies seem made notion viewer already knows mob works probably watching gangster movies although attitude comes across film tries fill holes can effort appreciable 
thankfully film doesnt become caught tedious details organized crime instead opts character development 
much story told simply interaction lefty donnie 
pacino outstanding pathetic hood speaks job manner blue collar worker 
hes old exhausted seems enjoy just anyone loyal employer years might 
 learn accomplishments quite impressive within context complains made top boss easy sympathize 
newell constantly plays aspect making major theme works well long run 
 donnie constantly impressing even oneupping lefty hard tell emotion powerful fact donnie getting closer nailing mob fact lefty shadowed 
 film tells story donnies life mafia creates many subplots individual conflicts doesnt always seem come together whole 
 storytelling genuinely interesting throughout even motions characters go seem familiar 
 resonance donnies actual assignment varies often reports back feds detail progress doesnt always seem much meaning 
back home wife maggie heche ready divorce hes never family suffering 
since based true story wouldnt doubt happen although way handled often borders melodramatic 
 major complaint film seems final act least real sense closure 
 climax sorts occur theres little feeling payoff 
 get happy ending good perhaps sad ending powerful 
aside minor general flaws donnie brasco manages solid piece storytelling character development 
 may routine good thats respectful
