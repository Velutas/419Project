roman emperor marcus aurelius richard harris chooses trusted general maximus russell crowe successor 
however emperors evil son commodus joaquin phoenix murders father announcement can made maximus well family sentenced executed 
maximus able escape executioners later captured sold slave proximo oliver reed 
proximo looking gladiators earn money former gladiator maximus reluctantly uses skills prove powerful gladiator 
 emperor commodus announces new games will held colisseum proximo takes gladiators battle 
maximus sees chance exact revenge commodus 
gladiator begins great battle sequence roman army germania actually able maintain interest now required minutes exposition kick ass opening sequence style moviemaking 
 downfall opening sequence editing style used 
 choppy slowmotion unsettling distracting 
 similar opening sequence saving private ryan nowhere near effective 
 actual gladiator battles thrilling also bit disjointed 
many times unclear exactly whats going 
 audience can tell blood spilled 
 sure whos blood whos hand though 
theres instance earlier film thats disappointing 
 comes maximus escapes executioners 
 flashes quick cuts later maximus free 
 still dont know exactly 
russell crowe become major star gleefully top role computer generated serial killer s virtuosity 
 whatever reason stardom never arrived 
 now 
 moviegoers now able say lets go see new russell crowe movie 
 gets best scene film one best moments recent movies reveals identity commodus colisseum 
 rousing chilling 
joaquin phoenix effective job making commodus person just cartoon character easily happened 
commodus conniving sneaky whiny phoenix never lets character get silly 
 good creepy performance 
oliver reed died filming gladiator huge loss acting world 
ive always fascinated reed 
hes one talented performers fine career ended direct video junk twilight years 
 ironic film probably gotten back real movies gives fun sincere performance 
 film dedicated will surely missed 
reeds death presented filmmakers obvious problem still scenes completed 
rather recast role end reshooting great deal footage digital version oliver reed created reported cost million dollars 
ironically probably money reed ever earned single film 
anyway digital effect used one scene aware twenty seconds arent looking wont even able tell 
 digital effects less convincing however 
 like always say noticable digital effects take movie immediately 
 sad good film distractions 
movies like fall roman empire spartacus seemed okay without use computer effects 
keep mind gladiator based real people real events entirely work fiction 
however work fiction thats great entertainment another film add list damn fine flicks released d
