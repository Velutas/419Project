 verdict spinechilling drama horror maestro stephen king featuring outstanding oscarwinning performance kathy bates 
geez french saunders field day set work parodying 
sorry nonbritish readers may familiar french saunders apologies 
 pair british comediennes jennifer saunders later went become edina monsoon absolutely fabulous series film spoofs years back including alien exorcist misery 
needless say amidst chucklesome impersonation kathy bates resemblance quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty sledgehammer reach jennifer saunders legs 
 despite lingering memory sketch although ive now seen film couple times now hobbling scene less disturbing 
im still left screaming telly revulsion 
 may memorable scene certainly worth watching 
stephen king whose film tv adaptations tend vary quality strikes gold simple yet strikingly compelling tale 
 nicely crafted psychological horror effortlessly succeeds drawing plight writer phil sheldon james caan 
rescued car accident annie wilkes bates introduces writers number one fan soon becomes prisoner 
 script kathy bates beautifully masterful performance won oscar work arminarm quickly begin realise beyond bubbly exterior woman basically nutty fruitcake fruity nutcake 
bates relishes demanding role performance nothing short masterpiece 
 times seems like innocent victim obsessive behaviour times shes rather tragic character often shes just damned scary 
 basically simple tale achieves large degree eloquence simplicity 
 involving engrossing experience considering basically twohander mainly set one locale remarkable piece cinema 
 jazzy special effects cheesy action sequences one relies solely upon rob reiners stylish directing wonderful performances bates caan 
oh havent really mentioned caan yet good job writer whos prisoner success annie obsessed books 
 doubt gathered bates well truly star show 
along pig course 
anyway tension builtup masterful aplomb scenes almost agonisingly tense 
theres dinner scene seldon goes nerveshattering lengths poison wine 
 succeeds 
knocks glass 
 bet threw pillow screen well 
 immortal words homer j simpson doh 
 nervewracking scenes include bit annie gone town sheldon starts snooping around house 
 cut annie car shes way home 
realises tries get back room cut 
 car shes getting near will make 
ok sequences arent exactly original perhaps unpredictable work 
boy work 
 film edge couch biting nails shouting screen suspense something right 
 course nauseating sequence aforementioned hobbling 
annie realises captive room shes going stop 
cue block wood placed strategically ankles huge sledgehammer feel ill just thinking 
nasty 
 builds nicely final scene sheldon finally gets upper hand tries kill crazy psycho 
 given one ridiculously overthetop fight scenes ive ever seen 
 gets hit head typewriter set fire head smashed wall just wont die 
sheldon isnt terribly good shape either 
 werent gorey almost laughable 
 terrifically effective film therefore daft climax easily overlooked 
misery tight tense intense chillingly entertaining thriller 
 directing firstrate performances bates particular contribute making suitably nightmarish little gem 
wonderful stuff
