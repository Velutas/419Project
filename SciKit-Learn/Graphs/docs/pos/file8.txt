one colleagues surprised told willing see betsys wedding 
 shocked hear actually liked 
 reaction understandable consider film revolves around molly ringwald hasnt made worthwhile film since 
 fact betsys wedding also alan alda film 
 ringwald making duds last four years alda involved several noteworthy projects including crimes misdemeanors new life 
written directed alda betsys wedding vibrant sliceoflife mixing dramatic moments big bowl whimsical humor 
aldas comic elixir smooth refreshingand welcome change pace usual summer fare 
 bride groom molly ringwald dylan walsh pivotal characters film far least interesting 
walsh nonentity screen presence door knob 
ringwald simply unbearable easily weakest link chain 
 looks hideous shortcropped orange hair red lipstick grotesque outfits 
shes supposed dress designer looks like clown 
 make matters worse ringwalds performance matches appearance 
thankfully alda keeps ringwalds screen time minimum far interested colorful periphery characters 
 wedding just device bring together brides workingclass italian family grooms rich gentile family 
ringwalds folks homey downtoearth alda freespirited father madeline kahn practical mother ally sheedy lonely sister 
walshs clan hand prim proper ostentatious 
 two families meet mingle movie becomes story culture clash one character puts money versus values 
ally sheedy wonderfully understated performance one films pleasant surprises 
sheedy expresses just eyes ringwald entire body 
 anthony lapaglia however seizes spotlight 
lapaglia plays stevie dee suave overly polite mafioso formally courting sheedy oldfashioned chivalry 
lapaglias sincere dimwitted character riot 
 whats uncanny lapaglia dead ringer robert de niro little bit alec baldwin thrown good measure 
lapaglia seems attended de niro school gangster acting inspired performance partly tribute rolemodel partly ripoff 
 dont know whether say star born star reborn know lapaglias overthetop performance missed 
 scrumptious comic acting however extends well beyond sheedy lapaglia 
joe pesci particular sinks teeth role aldas unscrupulous brotherinlaw slum lord mob ties cheating wife catherine ohara 
alda faced challenge directing acting somehow finds just right comic touch brides financiallystrapped father carpenter whose dreams bigger wallet 
 film adopts aldas psychological point view tries one plan wedding two pay 
 filmmaker aldas style humor remarkably restrained tasteful 
 doesnt comic genius woody allen alda possess inspiration make movies ten times entertaining slop usually passes comedy
