 watching first ten minutes japanese film will never eat bowl ramen way 
 scene old man teaching young one eat soupy bowl noodles master teach eager apprentice 
 caress noodles chopsticks says put roast pork side bowl apologize saying see soon 
 course meant parody earnestness underneath silliness makes take certain degree sobriety 
 begin appreciate food merely something eat something like something enjoy rather something experience 
experiencing process engages senses fulfilling one terms weaving total pleasure sum parts 
trust really want go find noodle shop point 
juzo itamis tampopo brings sense serious parody food forefront making story follow pattern american western set modern day japan

goro finds tampopos ambition shop people flock far away just eat bowl ramen 
 problem fare something less popular less appetizing 
however goro agrees help tampopo quest process seek wisdom elderly noodle expert enlist aid wealthy patron make friends former enemy 
 film filled many little scenes absolute gems 
take example tampopo tries buy recipe delicious soup another shop owner 
 price high owner store next door will secretly sell affordable sum 
tampopo meets store late night leads back room 
 protests thinking perhaps man ulterior motives insists 
just bolt exit shows small gap wall adjoining store noodle shop next door 
 peers takes notes watches cook make soup next day face filled joy can felt audience 
 scene comical effective filling viewer sense trepidation relief discovery 
theres also interesting scene goro introduces tampopo son bunch street people despite economic trappings gourmets master sommeliers 
 even watch one sneaks kitchen restaurant expertly prepares french omelet 
 scene meant bring laugh also says matter whether people rich poor food something everyone common enjoyment food experience shared 
 also number unrelated vignettes appearing throughout film help illustrate accentuate role food peoples lives 
 particularly effective one involves wife mother tended home doctor 
surrounded children obviously last hours life 
 husband comes home seeing worsened condition demands get make dinner 
 viewer knows husbands intention mean desperate normalcy family obviously deprived wife making dinner essential part 
 near miracle wife drags kitchen prepares quick meal brings awaiting family 
 family eats looks smiles 
preparing food family joy comfort brief moment enjoys normalcy 
 falls dead 
 moment family stunned father yells children keep eating 
 last meal mother ever made 
crying family finishes meal 
 scene comical awkward moving beautiful 
 including vignettes itami ran risk creating disjointed film surprisingly interrupt pacing main storyline 
instead even help contribute idea tampopos goal able serve exceptional food worthy even noble 
 film parodies western construction plot fairly predictable still enjoyable watch familiar way good guys come together final showdown 
 case showdown ramen 
 eat tampopos ramen soup tampopo knows succeeded 
 pretty obvious outcome will film changes whole perspective something consume every day life can afford cut little slack
