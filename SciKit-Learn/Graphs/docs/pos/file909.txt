 actually fan original liveactiondisney flick name starring hayley mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact parents never meet 
 everyone know feel remakes especially films happen enjoy fallacy unless youre going either capture exact spirit original something different maybe even just wrack brain come gasp new idea 
 remake originally top viewing list actually quite opposite 
contemporary liveactiondisney films one favorties anyway theyre usually unfunny alienating big fat bore least anyone age iq 
 one however shockingly bad 
 fact actually good 
 original good whats great doesnt necessarily retread original capture exact spirit become entertaining exact reasons original entertaining 
 cute innocent fun 
 pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along 
 lead star immensely appealing 
 parents also immensely appealing 
 im repeating cute innocent fun 
theres nothing risque save plot idea separating twins denying truth years ominously selfish precisely point movie aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember like kid 
 personally somewhere second third 
 can vividly remember taste movies wasnt weird diverse names godard kubrick werent even glimmer right eye back tune every sunday night couple years see abcs wonderful world disney theyd show liveaction andor madefortv disney flick hour per week 
 can remember mom taking sister along friends mothers see rereleased disney films like lady tramp pinnochio 
 sadly remember every single christmas without fail barage childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively christmas season wouldnt dare missing 
 can even remember seeing madefortv parent trap ii tv one night seen one saw original parent trap 
 late childhood movie deals issue divorce deals disneyized version 
 playful witty charming saw first time right now never experienced part childhood id probably dismiss 
id probably new version movie hadnt seen original perfect age 
watching remember fun watch disney film divorce started get thinking possibilities seeminglyperfect parents splitting affected adolescence 
 also brushed fear smooth stroke pointed even fuckedup situations things always work well manipulate things bit least better 
 new version also charming way 
 new cast contemporary feel first time awhile liveactiondisney flick tone isnt corny condescending just right 
 moments otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way 
 first time since original film kids actually know better foolish adults 
 story basically classic now repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played lindsay lohan just like played hayley mills original separated birth divorcing parents 
one annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave ever noticed london lives parents devoted foppish butler simon kunz works swingin fashion designer 
 grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports pokerplaying 
 hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live vineyard pseudomaid lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming 
 meet camp one annie wants go become rugged 
 feud look alltoo similar thus tight competition results nasty pranks winds seclusion together private outoftheway cabin 
 become friends learn eachother 
 know everything concoct scheme switch places one can meet parent theyve heard 
 learn eachothers lives detail make sure look alike requires hair cutting notoriously earpiercing scene like kiddie version hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best 
lindsay lohan doesnt necessarily copy acting style hayley mills original 
 comes just appealing 
 though add couple new things makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish snotty proper original respectively 
 also adds american british accent one one faking accent throughout really take notice can see fake ones accents arent exactly perfect 
shes also incredibly appealing merely cute especially notable since first feature film know notorious child actors especially first films 
 makes great protagonist helps supporting cast equally appealing 
dennis quaid fact hasnt likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made notable actor past just hes mr meg ryan 
ditto natasha richardson except just hasnt ever likable period 
 two make winning couple maybe winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work film 
instead bickering ensued original film adds another dimension another angle characters amiss original opening credits see glimpses courtship qe fall quickly madly love eachother back together films smarmy scenes come actually sentimental great way migraineinducing way many films 
 brings new parent trap level entertainment hasnt really existed since well original film years ago still money best liveactiondisney flick time 
 form intelligence wit makes plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot golddigging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented twins later film treat instead bore 
like original film transcends crap well case point takes two starring olsen twins treats children smart ones adults silly ones way around 
 everything knows exactly charming without biting can chew 
however comparison original bit better 
certain scenes work well nearly well worked original 
 liked way parents fought past dilemnas fought falling love better liked watching two old flames getting back together bottle wine somehow feuding always cinematic pleasing mere reminscing lesson extracted howard hawkscary grant films yesteryear 
 much film transcends mere cutedom compared original film almost drowns cutedom 
 original though gritty far stylized just suitable adult audiences young audiences 
 remake may never nearly great classic original film least knows treat source material dignity respect create virtually effects without bordering plagerism petty annoyances
