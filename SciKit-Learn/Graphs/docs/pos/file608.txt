us critictype people always shaking heads telling everyone movies arent thrill rides think back future ii one exceptions 
 original film spirit s spirit s full fights chase scenes cliff hangers special effects detective work course vision hightech future 
 film picks exactly first film left doc lloyd marty fox jennifer elizabeth shue travelling years future something bad going happen marty jennifers kids 
doc tells marty must take sons place incident will cause chain reaction marty mcfly jr says yes griff wilson one four different roles 
whoever said history tends repeat wasnt joking especially comes movies 
essentially chase scene marty endured s takes place year authentically exciting time obviously parody 
 end situation marty changed course history better seems like everythings copasetic right 
wrong 
since things go according plan back future movies 
 many minor conflicts details effect plot direction story wont even bother list 
basically get see marty old man house family etc also go back alternate back everything happening fast film never stops catch breath 
 films best aspect fact actually goes back first movie shows lot action occurred another angle 
 difficult convey sense wild zany fun without describing every little detail 
 thing sacrificed film suspense 
instead grand finale get lots little victories 
 end everything back normal something happens leads yet another sequel doesnt seem gratuitous 
 back future part ii really great adventure movie 
 certainly originality films lacks certain charm dominate throughout predecessor
