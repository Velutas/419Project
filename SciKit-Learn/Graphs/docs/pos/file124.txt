andrew lloyd webbers musicals preferably early work lyricist tim rice present musical totally unlike musical time 
webber rice subscribe gaity musicals oklahoma slapstickness shows like funny thing happened way forum 
 instead tackle hot issues past view differently pack together redundant catchy music well thoughtful lyrics 
like jesus christ superstar examined rise fall jesus last days fame perspective cool tune superstar dead judas comes back dead ask jesus didnt spread message wider evita takes inventive stance topic time famed wife argentinian dictator juan per n eva slept way top became famous chiefly got attention much like woman playing madonna although think madonna rise top musical talent among things 
 evita deals rise fall eva per n woman captured heart nation marrying juan jonathan pryce died young age creating international stir mourning unlike princess di two share bit common although wasnt like di slept top 
webber rice sure chose bizarre topics musicals always point 
 wish expose still show despite many drawbacks lying covering fascist husband show still good woman fairly good intentions death sad 
 also musical almost words unsung 
 film plays like rock opera much like jesus christ superstar many giant musical sequences just like old musicals even possess intelligent lyrics create intellectually enlightening experience also entertaining one 
 musical webbers musicals never undermine 
 balance energy intellectual depth walking fine line never stumbling either side 
 beginning evita kind letdown 
okay letdown 
im saying opening moments bad theyre pretty good 
 comes lifeless unentertaining totally unrewarding sequence cons singer jimmy nail taking eva buenos aires onenight stand 
 musical fun energetic sequence culiminating show stopper buenos aires also lifeless 
 punch pulled see eva screwed singer instead leaving ends singing sad tune another suitcase another hall meant later character screwed eva 
 portrayal eva beginning soft seeming like parker oliver stone adapted screen afraid present even narrated hater evas omnipotent antonio banderas presents negative light 
 looks like alan parker cant pull 
however film pulls together flash song giddily nihilistic song goodbye thank see eva go long line lovers help ascend magnificent darkly comical just gleeful 
 point film hypnotic satisfying satirical 
 punches thrown basic outline original musical tact 
 see eva woo marry juan get jail rise stardom falter bit come back gradually die cancer think cancer 
 importantly many themes musical carry well fillinginthegaps reconnassaince work 
juan pretty underwritten musical given extra scenes exposed eva accessory 
 muted scene tries visit respective room shunned allows us learn juan understand sadness 
 goodbye thank number film shows eva trying cover horrible government cheap petty things wooed nation saved government even left nations people downtrodden 
 despite nation still loved eva slipped death world mourned star 
thats narrator ch comes show wasnt great woman really expose fame 
describing character difficult mainly real realistic background hes said based revolutionary ch guevera two probably never met like film serves perspective eva even perspective cant help us feeling bad eva dies pathetic death 
alan parker stranger bizarre musicals hes done fame committments bugsy malone pink floyd wall latter absolutely brilliant nails film exposing everything 
 cry evita end feel way presented 
 direction manipulative reason show mourning 
 energy throughout lots bright colors scenes cinematically entertaning well enriching deep balcony scene sings dont cry argentina death sequence poignant becuase sad 
madonnas golden globe winning performance much like movie starts kinda downhill goes quickly remaning rest film 
 beginning looks like shes busy concentrating singing act eventually gets right though never really getting presence say patti lupone role american premiere back late s 
 death though brilliant 
 singing better though 
 know took lessons improve range still sounds like shes trying hard 
 sounds way soft several places comanding like patti 
lupone heard sing old evita cd just feel stage presence without even seeing 
 generally good although brilliance role really requires 
antonio banderas almost like guilty pleasure days im one people thinks rocks extremely comanding performance presenting lovable narrator 
 singing good though nothing compared original mandy patinkin 
 pretty good singing voice great range 
 jonathan pryce pretty awesome although brief times role juan seeming put poker face melancholy facade 
although gets rocky start rocky s polite really soon picks becomes wonderully poignant musical 
like musical released woody allens everyone says love reminder hollywood musical may dead can come back every now brief performance
