wong karweis fallen angels purely visceral level one exciting films ive seen long 
unfortunately wong seems interested experimenting camera creating tangible characters audience root 
ordinarily alone enough sink movie case fallen angels 
every shot film exciting just look 
wong really interesting things camera doesnt allow pyrotechnics completely take case last years dismal knock contained shot foot entering shoe 
ugh 
 movie follows three pairs lost souls struggle find meaning lives 
 cant say much didnt really know going time 
 fact wasnt halfway movie able distinguish character 
 constantly moving camera doesnt really allow audience associate one character 
 always kept distance people suppose order add feeling alienation felt characters 
 fallen angels refreshing changeofpace hollywood films never bother try anything different least visual level 
 fact id go far say fallen angels challenging visually mainstream hollywood film ive ever seen 
sure theres directors like robert rodriguez enjoy turning violence operatic orgies death see filmmaker like wong actually assaults senses images truly something worth celebrating 
 wong wishes become legendary filmmaker needs work incorporating actual story awesome images 
 far many instances fallen angels asked now people 
 first couple second couple 
 impossible keep track 
perhaps let audience know right away character introducing us name cards scorseses mean streets 
thats really besides point though 
wong karwei proven films thats hes moviemaker watch 
lets just hope hones storytelling skills next movies
