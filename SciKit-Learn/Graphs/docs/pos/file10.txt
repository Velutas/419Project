 american action film slowly drowning death sea asian wirefu copycats 
 pretty death leaving likes schwartznager stallone van damme wearing cement galoshes bottom kung fu sea 
sometimes mix results mindblowing spectacle unlike 
quality action amazing exciting stunt work s matrix can real gem 
 often hollywood gets wrong even pay chinese directors 
flying ninjas floating karate masters replaced soaring bronx detectives slow motion kicking scientists 
mostly laughable 
 hollywoods rush emulate success matrix trademark asian stunt choreography become joke art form 
 iron monkey latest asian import shows us get right 
iron monkey actually reissue film story th chinese vigilante rongguang yu fighting unique style shaolin kung fu rights oppressed bellies hungry 
 also piece narrative legendary chinese film hero wong feihong recently seen one overlooked possibly best films drunken master released u s legend drunken master 
unlike drunken master stars jackie chan adult feihong iron monkey finds much younger feihong szeman tsang father wong keiying yen chi dan thrust middle iron monkeys fight oppression 
iron monkey succeeds kung fu film since drunken master times fighting styles especially monkey devolve ridiculous twinkletoed floating films like crouching tiger hidden dragon director yuen wo ping eventually remembers bring action scenes back earth 
iron monkey heart hardcore kung fu action film rather kind drama la crouching tiger 
however brief moments profoundness shared characters pass outlaw hero goodhearted misguided enemy chief fox 
 moments others iron monkey manages transcend mindless kung fu nature touch hearts minds audience 
 way equal masterpiece like drunken master iron monkey dances quite nicely invading kung fu tune 
aka siunin wong feihung tsi titmalau
