 laughs come toys assault als toy barn apartment building 
 brief substitution new still delusional buzz welcome surprise id wondered sequel funny original without pompous attitude buzz displayed original 
 vocal performances firstrate 
tom hanks stands level enthusiasm puts work 
however one voiceover also stands horribly miscast 
kelsey grammer sounds nothing like old prospector 
although lot voiceover work commercials simpsons sideshow bob grammer makes slight variations voice 
 doesnt range pull role like stinky pete 
 animation even better first 
especially impressive textures figures 
 can now see difference flesh plastic first movie people looked just like toys now human skin looks soft slight bluish tint 
 can also see bo peep porcelain 
 can tell longwinded phrasing common merchandising disney pixars toy story pixars coming party 
 celebrate appended first project hilarious short two desklamps rubber ball beginning movie 
 made short incredible one considers relatively primitive level computer technology available 
 downside toy story follows formula original closely sequel comes bit stale sections tend drag 
overall though great time found story worthy successor first toy story 
bottom line one really fun whole family
