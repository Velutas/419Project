review disney continues trend producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly children enough wit charm adults interested least entertained story 
 basic premise every tarzan story boy raised african jungle gorillas becomes one never really understanding even noticing hes human lot different animals befriends 
 first third film shows tarzan comes adopted kala voiced glen close female gorilla lost child classic case darwanism 
 mate kerchak henriksen mean conservative leader pack gorillas make tarzans extended family 
 refuses acknowledge tarzan voiced alex d linz childhood scenes son often hold back killing tarzan continually dangerous wild things result childish instincts 
 feeling children will quickly able identify tarzan since really just kid wants fun funny adults fail comprehend 
later story transitions tarzan child fullgrown man voiced goldwyn encounter party three humans england jane porter driver beautiful woman something zoologist artist father prof archimedes q porter voiced nigel hawthorne also scientist slick cunning yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton blessed 
 easy tell story going times screenplay doesnt seem like written hastily dumbed childrens enjoyment 
sure theres lot cliche stuff like claytons smugness diabolical manipulation tarzan jane goofy supporting characters voiced rosie odonnell full brooklyn accent wayne knight hello newman 
theres also lot fun action tarzans swinging jungle vines sliding around tree branches trunks 
 just like skateboarding really fast sorts tricks mcdonalds commercials really prove point
