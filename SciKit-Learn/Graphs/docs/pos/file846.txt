 saw trailer film laughed harder quite time 
 therefore pretty well psyched see ever mindful trailer can make even mediocre film look good 
im happy say theres something mary one trailer letdowns 
 fact watching film quite fine way spend two hours 
 film opens flashback high school cumberland rhode island 
ted stroehmann ben stiller social reject cant seem get date upcoming prom comes defense mentally retarded warren w 
earl brown whos harassed one school jocks 
 seems warrens sister campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz impressed teds willingness stand defenseless brother despite real chance getting beaten 
mary takes immediate liking ted asks prom 
ted just flattered even knew name 
unfortunately prom night ruined ted accident zipper every man theater will wince sent hospital 
fast forward present ted cleaned now writes magazine weekly therapy sessions order deal obsession past years mary hasnt seen since fateful day 
 help friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon track love 
however pat finds mary falls soon competing affections 
theres something mary directed bobby peter farrelly brought us dumb dumber kingpin 
 exactly intelligent comedies guilty pleasure variety might want friends coworkers think great time watching 
 current film farrelly brothers come something youll enjoy also wont mind talking next day water cooler 
 film succeeds employing pretty wide range comedic styles subtle ridiculous gags might offensive seeming like residuals farrelly brothers last two films almost work 
 seen many movies recent past shoot mark often hit dead 
one minute youll laughing something ted says next youll howling sight dog dragging across floor marys apartment 
one great things film going ben stiller 
 perfectly cast role ted hes guy just looks awkward almost every situation 
teds nice fellow tries best reason another things just dont always work 
 comical also kind appeal really feel want come top 
actually ive liked stiller since short aired saturday night live back mideighties 
 film like theatrical trailer spoof tom cruisepaul newman film color money entitled hustler money 
 stiller played wince vince taken wing older man played john mahoney become bigtime bowling hustler 
 parody finest showed shortlived ben stiller show fox network late early 
like critic aired abc fox still mourn shows cancellation 
cameron diaz absolutely enchanting film although character seems obsessed perfection men dates qualities looks make mary look paperthin times 
however diaz pulls role panache charm can still see shes got guys just falling 
heck even found laugh cute even though thought annoying appearance made tonight show last week 
 girlfriend remarked matt dillon doesnt change know really true 
 ralph macchio must hang something 
maybe live dick clarks pool house 
anyway heres another good piece casting dillon slips beautifully role guy tries worm way marys heart 
 supporting performances also good 
chris elliott bigger part abyss yes check next time less annoying cabin boy 
lin shae plays marys neighbor magda also appeared landlady kingpin provides good laughs especially scenes benjilike dog acts focal point funniest moments film 
lee evans marys friend tucker displays flexibility acting accents surprises contributes interesting plot twist 
 farrelly brothers scriptwriters ed decter john j strauss keep comedic pacing going arent noticeable times film drags 
 problem saw use couple musicians provide segues several key scenes 
 appear nowhere actually sing plotrelevant information right toward camera 
 device amusing three seconds opened film 
 got little annoying unfortunate spots interrupt otherwise smooth flow 
fortunately filled sight gags humorous lines solid comedic acting theres something mary will still laughing leave theater
