plot human space astronaut accidentally falls upon planet ruled apes 
 taken prisoner along humans tries best escape simian captors 
oh yeah mention apes can talk 
kewl 
critique despite film looking like tim burton movie lead human character showing signs human find generally entertained throughout film recommend fun summer fare 
although thing sets movie apart others definitely incredible ape makeup jobs characterizations 
 mean completely convinced every single one apes real 
 also give actors inside costumes waking three morning every day get makeup slobbered hours coming costumed exteriors selling us characters screen well 
 especially enjoyed bonham carters performance believed developed character entire film human ape tim roths bad guy chewed scenery oozed evil every scene took part 
plotwise liked beginning film whole buildup wahlberg got village escape fight scenes things got deserted area final battle sequence kinda lost bit interest 
 much intrigued interactions characters whole idea human beings animals end battle sequence just seemed bit typical kind film 
 also hated kid character just got nerves didnt really care way battle sequence resolved wont ruin cmon guys 
coulda thought something little plausible 
 thing held movie back anything else lead character cold demeanor zero chemistry shared either one interspecies love interests 
 dude didnt seem give rats ass anyone ultimately didnt really care happened either 
now im sure fault actor script film suffered 
visually movie also nice look especially apes definitely expected greater coolness tim burton 
 surprise ending highlighted original planet apes film back felt little tacked despite interesting didnt really make much sense unless look sequel point view 
 overall loved whole feel planet apes ruled manner treated humans screamed shouted reverted entire evolution chain didnt appreciate films lack human character development kris kristofferson even movie fact lead male female humans just plain boring 
 still recommend film fun summer movie laughs creepiness really cool premise 
ps anyone seen original believe didnt least bring back scene lead human character case mark wahlberg goes nuts world hes suddenly thrust mad house 
type thing 
 guy film barely seems put fact hes surrounded apes can speak english 
wheres joblo coming 
 arrival battlefield earth godzilla instinct mission mars pitch black planet apes sleepy hollow
