bob happy bastards quickie review 
 mummy 
brendan frasers stuck past least time something better quote sitcom lines try woo alicia silverstone 
fraser lead star mummy second directorial effort action director stephen sommers also brought us decent thrill ride deep rising 
 rough adaptation film say rough focuses special effects guy bandages like boris karloff engulfed 
 cares movie sort swashbuckling quality cant get oh say godzilla armageddon 
fraser plays soldier gets premonition battle soldiers egyptian ground 
basically little sign mummy buried underneath priest named ihmoetep buried alive taking part murdering king making mistress 
 plan wake back wake also making invincible 
 course fraser returns site years later librarian rachel weisz brother john hanna along former buddy deep risings kevin j oconnor americans 
guess 
yup ihmoetep arnold vosloo awakens wreaks havoc 
fire flies sky flesheating beetles crawl well ihmoeteps plan begins unfold 
ok really new story way sommers tells entertaining enough 
 special effects industrial light magic top notch acting fraser weisz isnt half bad either 
 action pretty intense favorite scene sandstorm shocking scenes just jolt horrorloving folks well 
 phantom menace beater youre looking solid warmup summer movie season wont find better film wraps mummy 
 doesnt give fraser forgiveness blast past encino man nothing will
