rush hour 
 whats problem hours clones days 
 always try thing eddie murphy nick nolte 
 problem plagued clones mention actual sequel another hours complete waste film 
 last someone different take matter director brett rainer 
rush hour features jackie chan first u s action movie playing chinese detective whos flown us investigate kidnapping chinese consulates daughter 
 course fbi upset hell interfering investigation stick lapd office big mouth course thats chris tucker 
 makes rush hour work damn well chemistry energetic chan absolutely hilarious tucker 
tucker mouths chan every given opportunity im michael jackson tito chan delivers zingers well terrific fight scenes 
 storys pretty much average fare decent twist involving main villain highly clouded figure named jun tao 
 least entertaining concept excellently realized
