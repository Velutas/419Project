 thinking going tell offbroadway theater 
 silly goose 
well gabe kaplan isnt movie rounders film actor come gamblers life 
 rounders poker gabe plays poker thought kind neat connection 
sorry segue lack thereof 
matt damon plays mike mcdermott law student also singular talent game poker 
hes playing proficient caught bug 
 goes underground games new york city knows regulars knows win 
 beginning film hes built nice thirty grand nest egg takes speakeasytype gaming parlor big boys play 
mike make bid upper echelon staking teddy kgb john malkovich oreomunching cardshark ties russian mafia 
mike potential take large pot go vegas buy world series poker instead loses single hand 
months later hes paying way law school driving delivery truck 
 mikes best friend poker buddy worm edward norton finishes jail term hustling students wants pick right left working team part others betting cash 
although mike stopped playing cards promise girlfriend fellow law student jo gretchen mol worm connives mike playing mike bitten bug slides slippery slope risking relationship education reputation playing poker becomes focus life 
 make film gambling filmmaker will usually play glamorous side get audience behind characters 
 moviegoers will care whole lot guy leisure suit terry cloth shirt sitting folding card table stogie mouth 
rounders however seems go latter former 
 card clubs mike worm frequent arent glamorous 
theres basement lodge elk heads wall goulash joint kinds locales director john dahl sets shots 
except one brief instance two players visit atlantic city film bereft flashing lights casinos pleasant color green felt table 
 reason rounders still captures attention less game poker personalities enjoy slaves 
 given nice set interesting characters clear motivations good actors play 
matt damon natural mike struggles desire play straight narrow finishing law school answering may true calling playing professional poker 
ed nortons worm truly worm always looking angle playing everyone theyre worth 
john turturro amazes acting range tones film playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy time now plays underground games make rent child support payments 
hes friend mentor mike turturros lowkey performance totally convincing just john malkovichs heavilyaccented teddy kgb imposing adversarial dragon mike must slay prove 
martin landau also thrown mix one mikes law professors abe petrovsky 
 landau slips well role character spitting personal anecdotes staying true ones self facilitates channeling storyline toward predictable ending 
perhaps weak link otherwise formidable lineup acting talent however gretchen mol just didnt seem much presence screen 
shes genuine peach look kind cross actress renee zellweger singer jewel wouldnt surprised three formed kind blondhaired triumvirate attempted take world delivered lines seemed flat found looking matt damons reactions instead 
 good thing rounders doesnt get bogged character development statement making much cant find time humor 
 film peppered nicely scenes make laugh keep pacing going sequence mike worm move rapidly around new york one game next widely different locales 
one game cigar club stitches 
 love sweetness dark maduro wrapper says one players clearly interested displaying pretentiousness cigar one hand cards 
 hoping mike worm really take guys 
 poker played rounders potential confusing 
 might think know lot poker think 
luckily given narration damon intricate moments explain whats going 
 narrations informative intrusive apprise us stakes certain players want things 
 nice characters develop comprehension world 
 film success survival realm underground poker rounders delivers spades 
wait 
 film culture cards rounders ace 
hang 
packed great acting great characters rounders full house 
okay guess thats enough 
oh way ever want get game ol gabe kaplan sure bring note epsteins mother
