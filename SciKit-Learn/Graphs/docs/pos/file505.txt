 guess credit jackie chan general likeability franchise rush hour ruined even nauseating comedy chris tucker 
im fan jackie chan just medium movie lets impressiveasever martial arts schtick show comic timing well 
 worked better name title 
 plot basic martial arts flick clothesline stunts special effects 
 time around evil smugglers led ricky tan john lone makes fortune shipping counterfeit money united states im still sure can make fortune place one can exchange fake bills real ones 
 way tell phony money genuine article set fire see color burns 
 course hong kong detective lee chan trashtalking lapd detective james carter tucker take bad guys authorities extent even exist stay way 
rush hour turns tables first film carter gets two trouble lee winds get 
 guarantee rating least half grade higher anyone chris tucker cast foil jackie chan 
 refuses shut 
 voice feel like jackhammer head jokes just arent funny pathetic mixture subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes wind offensive funny 
 realize movie like biggest laughs come letting actors ad lib beyond script dictates didnt anyone realize irritating tuckers incessant ranting raving 
 comedian offer dont care see films 
fortunately chan makes marvelous straight man redeems fledgling comedy completely 
 often one actor can completely save movie name whenever hes screen rush hour comes nearly breathtaking often hilarious life 
much hinges dubious value cute watch chan try player cares 
 can think high concepts funnier 
 movie ends outtakes usual show chan isnt perfect indeed take tries get incredible stunts look seamless 
chris tucker botches lines well mistakes funnier anything says whole movie 
 lot people pointed rush hour isnt different predecessor tone style 
 liked original like sequel though certain sidekick seems done best ruin 
director brett ratner family man keeps moving entertaining pace manages keep laughs coming despite fairly miserable hit miss ratio jokes guess sometimes shotgun approach works 
 great jackie chan jackie chan thats enough 
 next jay silent bob strike back
