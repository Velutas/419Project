writerdirector m night shyamalan tough act follow sleeper hit sixth sense 
 exactly one follow one biggest popular thrillers recent years 
 shyamalan answer must come easy nuclear physics kindergartners 
 new film measure breakthrough box office smash though 
 answer question easy one either 
 far pacing goes sixth sense seemed almost interminable 
 wasnt surprise ending revealed realized film actually intentionally perfectly paced order give audience ample time reconnect information seen climax reached 
 unbreakable shyamalan gave film much satisfying pace many ways blows away film come 
 story moves along steady pace shyamalans direction excellent camera almost constantly moving 
 tons great shots film least conversation opens film willis character another train passenger 
 shot seems though filmed like watching two talk train seats camera steadily glides back forth two actors speak 
also impressive films score james newton howard also scored shyamalans sixth sense similar film stir echoes well years dinosaur 
several scenes driven catchy beat help increase tempo film 
one best examples scene dunne goes train station exercise powers 
 music combination stellar visuals really go long way towards making incredible movie 
 one soundtrack make must purchase year one 
 film also boasts great performances including precocious child actor trying vie oscar throne left vacant haley joel osment 
willis turns great performance sad sack dunne just cant seem figure hes depressed last years 
 character almost seems pathetic first meet eventually grows elijahs tutelage 
jackson one better actors time turns yet another great performance ever injured elijah 
though hairstyle absurd jackson seems infuse great deal pain role mortar board hairdo can easily overlooked 
robin wright penns role seems slightly underwritten still manages get across intense hurt characters need love husband desire make things work 
spencer treat clark dunnes young son jeremy shows shyamalan still knack picking young actors turns one competent performances film 
 characters jeremys perhaps emotional clark great job role 
 film lose points though surprise ending 
shyamalan said interviews going ending blew away one presented sixth sense found saying 
 unbreakable revealed ending 
 ending bad just ending doesnt quite emotional punch films 
plus almost seems like sets sequels wont reveal ending youll understand mean see 
essentially means shyamalan made another good film unbreakable 
 real problem ending doesnt quite fill shadow left predecessor 
 long isnt held standard sixth sense set ultimately will remarkably well liked film 
one thing seems clear though 
shyamalan definitely affinity comic books like share world many comic book fans will also delight vision presents film
