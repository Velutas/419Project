 good long since good old fashioned thriller mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters even longer since saw thriller actually shock cared characters merely judged actually allowed human foibles flaws strengths emerge radiantly 
id saw least couple decades even far back great hitchcock thrillers though im hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train 
yet almost good 
 simple yet strangely complex astonishingly rewarding instead moving plot point plot point merely laying theymightbecaught overtones instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists can go without ever judging either evil even immoral 
elegantly directed sam raimi yes simple plan concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton dimwitted brother billy bob thornton drinking buddy brent briscoe 
without anyone around possibility one come looking three debate debate finally reach decision yes will keep authorities possible owners cash come looking generally dont flaunt anything dont want flaunt theyll keep stored away custody paxton 
 possibilites circumstance much diverse endlessly play cat mouse authorities b try fight rightful owners either villainous just c fight amongst 
 simple plan though borrows little 
 little tiff cops subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole bit inside feuding 
 austin powers say thats necessarily bag baby 
 admired film makes far superior unique thriller successfully able cake eat 
 effectively involves traditional thriller cliches like ones mentioned time involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black duffle bag 
 steps taken neatly cover things subsequent steps go miserably awry film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters slowly losing souls humanity 
 one early scene paxton thornton make trip back plane return money doesnt look like stolen bad idea thornton screws continuously throughout movie paxton major coveringup read homicide 
instead quick murder immeadiate handswashing raimi shows lengthy painful shot lowangle onto paxtons face tries sift emotions reach conclusion 
theres similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder hes committing taking horror also wonderfully effective previous shot even better morally complex gutwrenching 
 short probably best piece direction raimis ever done demonstrating sometimes simplest way something yields best results proof watch persona s sex scene witness may best scene ingmar bergmans ever done 
 film hardly stops follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity depletion thereof 
yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely stamping plot points story 
 time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical aid pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi soon horror situation escalating tragic heights 
theres least two grand shootouts least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history arrive dont come masochistic delight cringeinducing horror 
 one actually sinking chair mantra cant can 
streeming head 
 fact film getting many comparisons coens superior forget fargo many similar moments manic insanity attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct hands overthetop distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing 
 seeing evil dead films id hardly assume raimi able pull something like although moments film easily dubbed raimi moments rifleshot notwithstanding 
instead raimi directs maturity gentle touch easily letting story characters coexist still letting traditional raimi elements come like offbeat comic touches 
 particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob brilliant creation 
 dimwittedness often hilarious film every line uttered greeted howling laughter theres authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure totally laughing 
 chuckles gets necessarily ones fullcondescension thornton damn real 
jacobs multidimensional character stupid see much flaw strength character simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system primarily towards middle bud coconspirator begins make heavy waves concerning money 
 final third film spends much time many touches upon character thornton also screenwriter scott b smith adapting book way just great 
 particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend told thornton sincerity acception cruel story reversed nearsweetness strength saddened character 
thornton absolutely brilliant performance far best performance hes ever given proof hes best character actor contemporary cinema dont believe go back watch wonderful performance primary colors performance nominated oscar hadnt year hes easily able slip character make completely utterly believable 
 brings much weight film character actors difficult picturing anyone else role 
 rest cast great paxtons declining working man chelcie ross amiable town sheriff 
even fonda shows talents nicely 
 complaints film plot almost simplistic times seems much like exercise like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved 
 occasional narration usually annoying narration used extreme caution especially youre trying set things andor express emotions didnt raimi watch first murder scene 
 thing can usually go wrong movie ending basically amiss 
 wont reveal way cruel much outsider setup appearance plane wasnt already much anyway 
 film deals much intimately humanity characters involved wrong ending 
imagine charactercontrolled ending otherwise like crime punishment police caught instead breaking confessing im comparing simple plan dostoevsky 
 ending work despite protestations something incessantly nagging unsatisfying qualms happy clam just ignore go day 
 despite mere claims make mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout even sometimes curdling situations occured kind gore factor thankfully minimal film places characters situations gives painful things overcome ive frankly seen much like quite awhile 
 least since previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
