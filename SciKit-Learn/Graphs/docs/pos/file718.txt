since movies slavery shield us true horrors theyre portraying fitting say beloved come real shock film 
 confusing bizarre tough film watch film ive seen year thats necessarily threehour running time 
 beloved challenging watch filled tough powerful poetry takes us completely guard instead straightforward hollywoodized story happened slaves freed beloved comes cry anguish actually lived happened rather toni morrison wrote novel upon based 
 beloved tells story exslave named sethe played oprah winfrey lives large farm north children 
 film opens house terrorized poltergeist shakes things wounds dog makes things generally uncomfortable family 
sethe proud though will move 
 sons run away leaving daughter denver kimberly elise alone ghost without factual explanation 
 couple years pass ghost remains one day man named paul d danny glover another exslave knew sethe years ago worked plantation together arrives asking lodging 
 wandering around since left plantation enters house turns red becomes incredibly hot 
 remarks thinks evil sethe replies aint evil 
 just sad 
 time passes paul d become fervent member household ghost disappears 
 return one day going discover young woman sitting house 
 name beloved played thandie newton almost zero motor skills 
 stumbles around halfgrabbing onto things knocking speaks lets low guttural sound eventually turns baby talk 
 let house begins turn things upside 
 beloved acts like incredibly difficult chamber drama paired ghost story 
 scenes consist people arguing one claustrophobic lowlit room occasional flash past see images horror thank god modernday psychoanalysts 
sethe paul d lived hellish times forever implanted memories slavehood old plantation includes images sethe raped white plantation hands nipples licked prompting cry paul d reminiscing took milk 
worst month freedom allowed live like free person working blacks farm seeing old plantation owners arrived presumedly take children back 
 runs barn near carrying four children old owners burst discover murdered one ready murder rest dont leave alone 
 inquired moment paul d moment halfway film says doesnt regret 
 killed daughter live horror convinced right thing 
 course beloved really daugher materialized though arent flat told later film 
beloved represents pain suffering slaves went shows difficult deal freedom tortured long 
thus beloved becomes sortaredux andrei tarkofsky scifi classic solaris cosmonaut discovers wife commited suicide years materialized orbiting planet complex brain system 
 film spoke volumes humanity memories constantly regretting happened past ever literally came back haunt us control us completely 
 beloved moves along freely without lot explanation part extremely respectable 
 interesting films ones dont explain everything us leaving gaps characters supposed fill act present tense 
sethe never fully explained character understand actions since shes played oprah winfrey 
 well decade since last major performance color purple judging two films ill bet shes one best actresses working today 
 strictly actress 
 talk show suppose great entity prevented becoming noteworthy actress thats shame brings much movie 
emotion 
sadness 
strength 
watching strong sethe whos afraid past shes built rather strong protective coating around break discovers beloved really makes movie really great 
 makes real 
thats say perfect film 
 fact id wager say fact confusing painful watch prevents truly great film 
 oprahs performance powerful easily sympathetic im dying see win least oscar nomination february structure film doesnt show happened children till halfway film prevents us really making cohesive connection film 
 doesnt necessarily move though theyre memories one particular character end lost control sethe takes bed unable truly identify anymore 
 despite tediousness perhaps thats point 
 distancing end film may just part way built start since figure crossed identifiable needs get back reality 
 part film seems like cry pain slaves really wants 
jonathan demmes direction bizarre nature story creates right mood making tough film sit making sure audience feels uncomfortable characters 
theres admire like way flashbacks pop freely without real organization just like real life way ending leaves somewhat open pain suffering laced touch optimism 
 acting winfrey amazing anticipate will get oscar nomination 
everyone raving thandie newtons performance rewarded 
however must noted everyone easiest part 
act like baby 
throw things 
stumble around 
chew food mouth open 
 think theres another performance worthy oscar conisderation kimberly elise daugher stay sensible sane carry burden mothers loss reality towards end 
 newton isnt great shes annoying wacky role demands 
 just elise tougher job pulls even better 
despite fact film winfrey written writer morrison director demme beloved still done well 
costing think around ninety million dollars since grossed twentytwo 
unfortunately film little intense viewers even can stand almost anything recently viewed hour long epic caligula worst film ever seen life mere sittings 
although respect beloved cant say really enjoyed
