seen august p m rotterdam square cinemas rotterdam ny theater free using sonyloews critics pass 
theater rating good seats sound picture 
war topic cant help glorified way portrayed media 
movies documentaries even history books way making darker side humanity exciting since general aspects focused strategy politics victory 
 easy forget war basic form battle armies slaughter 
forgotten easily fact soldier matter rank importance real fleshandblood person just number 
 saving private ryan one films dares play aspect especially unapologetic realistic delivery 
 proves theres huge difference battling killing 
 film opens one graphic disturbing scenes recent memory 
 world war ii dday exact u s military invading omaha beach nazis ready 
spielberg uses many techniques create total sense reality 
instead positioned cameras footage seems shot camera operators running alongside soldiers just scared 
 sense stability constant anxious confusing motion giving us feeling middle battle just vulnerable poor troops 
 poor proper word describe pathetic yet innocent men fighting 
 little dialogue throughout loud battle prologue define characters 
 dont get feeling handsome actors playing heroic roles men kill killed reasons beyond understanding 
 nazis portrayed enemies hated people must destroyed theyre 
 movies good guys can run firestorm bullets bombs get scratch reality wouldnt happen 
 men nothing shield protect besides metal flanks dead bodies 
 sitting ducks realize perspective wellsecured germans can actually see theyre shooting unlike americans must fire general direction avoid getting heads blown 
perhaps film flawed providing backstory war men really seems part theme 
 film seems rely audiences sense patriotism american military right good nazis inherently evil 
 battle scene eventually focuses group men miraculously survived made way close enemy stronghold whole foot progression begin inflict damage 
 admit first glimpse victory nazis sprang couldnt help feel sense joy relief 
 triumph odds cliche sure theres nothing cliche graphic detailed atmosphere really happened 
one surprising aspects film little story construction yet events take place make sense interesting 
 plot practically irrelevant since film concerned reality war soldiers meet 
tom hanks stars captain miller relatively average man happens leader platoon 
hes never obsessive generic cartoonish characteristic might dominate character like 
 doesnt want men given mission intends carry 
 mission film concerned title states saving private ryan 
 series command started ordinary clerical worker brought generals attention three brothers iowa killed action mother will receive notices eachs death simultaneously 
 learn fourth brother stationed somewhere europe make top priority returned safely mother 
 easy sympathize situation one lose children 
 finding one man war miller puts like trying find needle stack needles 
 saving private ryan isnt just dramatic device thematic one 
 salvation represents sense innocence country world even trying convince still 
 millers company hears mission scoff idea assuming dead miller isnt quick shrug 
 knows thing can really save soldiers death hope now opportunity make someones sense hope reality 
 mission find ryan gives millers group destination direction 
along way many things happen good bad 
 battles fought major accomplishments war encounter german soldiers choice 
 act killing becomes one films major philosophical metaphors 
 soldiers dont mind killing soldiers blind battle come across lone survivor begs let go can barely stop killing cold blood kind vengeance losses 
unfortunately death fact war films try avoid comes main characters spielberg doesnt want us think men invincible 
 fact small amount color personality sketched man performances good enough make method work 
although characters somewhat typical actors maintain control material time 
whether theyre arguing telling stories back home fighting germans never go overboard always seem believable 
sure theres zinger war doesnt change fact boys will boys 
 one dies can feel loss even though hardly knew 
 final act brings story full circle another tremendous violent battle sequence 
private ryan found facing four one odds can americans defeat germans keep ryan alive 
thats premise thrills symbolic everything film worked 
 wrong say film either happy sad ending ends way must end 
 remember reading calvin hobbes comic strip calvin asked dad something like dad armies men killing solve problems 
 saving private ryan adult version question
