 truman show paramount pictures running time hour minutes starring jim carrey ed harris directed peter weir long wait jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes big screen 
 case youve asleep last months plot centres truman burbank carrey leads seemingly idyllic life beautiful town seahaven 
 life seems perfect however controlled christoff harris creator truman show program burbank unwittingly hero 
thats right burbanks life broadcast live american public seahaven inhabitants inclosed massive sound stage 
 film takes jerry springer format one step far 
 idea different easy director screenwriter dumb appeal lowest common denominator 
luckily film remains sensible enough appeal ages yet never seems dumb carrey movie 
talking carrey hes perfect movie enjoying best role career 
 character reinforced stanley ipkiss mask completely suited carreys persona 
 occasionally falls ace ventura mode shrieking silly generally audience watching subdued carrey 
hes completely dramatic like film promises however 
ed harris brings extreme intensity christoff megalomaniac creator show 
quiet well spoken burns image viewer 
unfortunately hes barely film first hour dosent appear 
also disappointing natascha mcelhones character sylvia 
 plays role well character sadly underwritten pushed sidelines just audience used 
 supporting cast excellent town seahaven looks delightfully perfect perfect creepy 
 philip glass soundtrack also superb used great effect film 
peter weir keeps film going clearly fun 
 film far upbeat previous films dead poets society green card 
although slightly slow begin half hour film pace really picks christoff introduced fully film roll 
sadly though film practically film full steam 
also concerning ending slightly ambiguous disappointing 
 screenwriter andrew niccol bought us gattaca delivers entertaining script manages keep plot trim 
 christoffs plans keep truman get increasingly silly never go line easy niccol 
also theres funny gags involving product placement people watch show 
overall truman show excellent entertainment 
certainly different usual crap hollywood produces viewed everyone 
 offers something every member audience almost certainly come disappointed 
overall rating
