plot bunch bad guys dressed elvis impersonators rob vegas casino presley convention 
 boys eventually get together split money plans change doublecrosses occur dealing wheeling goes crew set road 
whos whos real bad guy whos gonna get bang courteney cox just questions will answered rest movie 
critique funnest movie ive seen far year 
 got style got tough guys talkin shite got plenty bullets go around 
 definite hunkahunka burnin adventure 
 guys guy movie one thatll set jollies high dig rough stuff 
 original goes little long costner russell make happen two shitekickin elvis lovers dont stop till less drop 
 movies got pretty intensive shootout scenes one coolest robbery scenarios ive ever witnessed featuring several elvises guns blazin kings music playing background decent helping doublecrosses sharp dialogue funny moments 
 fact even though cast filled many name actors bactors might part bit succeed well passing torch onto next victim 
 true glue holds film together spirit elvis costner russell play badass characters t sure russells road costner surprised nastiness 
 guess hes pissed boxoffice bombs hes late sure played great unstable elvis impersonating robber 
 end bottom line movie fun kickin ass making sure theres enough bubblegum around chew afterwards 
 smoke em got em folks 
 also one really great showdown scene costner cop thatll crackin lovin time 
 violent scenes movie violent entire film wrapped soundtrack thatll kick arse end theatre next 
 actually come surprise anyone director movie comes music video background plenty mean plenty camera tricks cuts edits kind flick actually works 
 film perfect though starts pretty big bang pulls way gun us slows pace somewhat middle characters intermingle disperse 
 personally kept game despite soft spots enjoyed overall ride well 
 mention courteney cox looked megahot movie 
 okay 
well just 
 coulda done without whole romance angle honest doesnt take much film generally covered blood explosions guts elvis nods 
try see many inside connections king can guess 
 course secret quite big elvis fan please take whole review grain salt mind 
 also like types guy movies lot even though film doesnt bring much originality table offer pretty coherent story nice twists turns humor big ol helping whoopass coming straight costner russells respective boots 
probably film everyone definitely enjoy guns charismatic bad guys fun entirely disposable adventure 
now see many elvis songs ive used pun way phony review 
 elvis songs also recommend movie
