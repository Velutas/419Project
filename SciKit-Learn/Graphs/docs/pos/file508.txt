capsule sidesplitting comedy follows merciless logic almost end 
 without providing good deal genuine laughs 
 comedies days one flaw 
theyre funny 
 think theyre funny devoid anything really penetrating dastardly 
occasionally good funny movie sneaks past deadening hollywood preconceptions humor get real gem ruthless people instance established microcosm setup played bitter end 
liar liar built way just funny 
 one movies ive seen laughing consistently almost way instead couple setpieces inspired laugh think dismal fatal instinct whole movie works like clockwork 
jim carrey playes highpowered lawyer lying natural breathing 
 one thing takes seriously though son can sense affection right away 
 wife divorced seeing another man now looks like may move away together 
 son goes course 
 movie sets early material good timing remarkable balance jim carreys overthetop persona reality 
 plot springs action snubbed deliberately father birthday kid makes wish blows birthday candles just one day dad cant lie 
 gets wish 
 happens next sidesplitting 
everything turns confrontation cornered bum change shouts 
im giving money know youll spend booze 
 want get office without step debris decaying society 
 cant even get elevator without earning black eye 
 whats worse hes now gotten expensive divorce settlement requires twist truth like abstract wire sculpture 
carrey used find unfunny gotten better schtick even limited one 
 uses great effect movie 
 scene tries test ability lie nearly demolishes office process theres grin breaking across face right now just remembering scene 
 cant even write lie fingers twitch body buckles like someone throes cyanide poisoning tries talk like hes speaking tongues 
equally funny scene beats pulp dont ask tries drink water keep outbursts courtroom fails semipredictable results winds biting bullet gets called boardroom everyone ask think 
 scene alone may force people stop tape minutes end 
 movie sustains laughs also flashes insight almost end 
 shame movie insists big ridiculous climax involves carreys character flagging plane using set motorized stairs breaking leg etc simple reconciliation trick 
 stupid pentup climax always obligatory 
 even part movies real agenda 
thankfully liar liar survives carrey 
maybe merciful reflection 
 id laughed might needed iron lung
