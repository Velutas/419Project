 critics including siskel ebert record stating martin scorseses raging bull story boxer jake la motta best film s 
since still number s films havent seen dont feel qualified make judgment ill say without hesitation raging bull great motion picture surprised handful films released january december come close level 
biopics often fall one two categories overblown hero worship dry dull textbook account 
 rare movie moniker based life comes across anything sporadically energetic marginally entertaining 
raging bull perfect counterexample brilliant argument film makers continue work genre 
 picture takes life boxer jake la motta middleweight icon s s develops one compelling character studies ever reach big screen 
 minutes director martin scorsese actor robert de niro title role us mesmerized individual turns sympathetic sad horrifying 
historically raging bull said mostly accurately lions share details culled la mottas autobiography cowritten joseph carter peter savage 
however although la motta credited movies consultant reportedly unhappy final result portrays nothing short uncouth insensitive lout 
 la motta movie man extreme appetites driven base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy blind rage 
sex violence inextricably linked 
 title apt la motta raging bull

raging bull side rocky 
sylvester stallones tale boxing triumph released great critical acclaim 
 won best picture oscar sequel arrived theaters raging bull went production 
 rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull takes cold unflinching look violence inside outside ring 
 scorseses primary aim present riveting deconstruction la motta man never backs away showing seedy ugly underside sport gambling greed organized crime force fighters throw matches continue working 
rocky shows boxing noblest raging bull shows diseased 
theres little can say hasnt already said de niros performance 
 career included many fine roles outstanding 
 level intensity de niro brings la motta unwavering 
 although theres lot travis bickle de niros character taxi driver la motta scorsese de niro go great lengths make sure never fully sympathize least understand forces drive 
 complete characterization perfect example acting 
 younger jake de niro trim fit 
 fat older man de niro gained pounds turned body grotesque parody normal form 
 many actors go far 
 best oscar statue one testimony lasting power performance 
cathy moriarty joe pesci earned nominations supporting work although neither won 
 portrayals raw energy infuses de niros 
pesci basically recreated personality two scorsese films goodfellas casino presents joey slightly intelligent version brother 
 misogyny violence still better concealed 
 joey snaps one scene pounds mobster frank vincent startling behold 
moriarty hand must play temptress virginal qualities kind woman ensnare jake 
later shes called upon portray battered wife mother whose love turned fear 
scorsese cinematographer michael chapman elected shoot bulk raging bull blackandwhite home movie segments color 
 choice perfect movie giving raging bull unique look era blackandwhite approach almost unheard 
 one important recent exception schindlers list eschewed color reasons raging bull 
 blackandwhite especially considering scorseses choice shots use slow motion violence stark disturbing 
theres room romanticism ring inky black blood staining canvas 
 fight sequences director also uses number pointofview shots designed show world however briefly la mottas perspective 
scorsese chosen end film la mottas loss sugar ray surrendered middleweight crown 
 career downhill 
yet director allows film run thirty minutes pivotal moment stretching decade la mottas future 
 reason obvious scorsese isnt interested boxing character 
following retirement la motta still violent volatile ever lost arena can legally unleash tendencies 
 see results beast let loose society consequences actions reduce parody former self 
 feel surge pity la motta quietly recites marlon brandos speech waterfront 
 coulda contenda 
perhaps raging bull indeed best film s 
 certainly perilously close zenith
