 example happy gilmore sandler plays rookie golfer trying beat selfconfident jerk pro 
 star comic enough motivation drive movie sandler rookie also wants win prize money help grandma keep house 
 extra motive doesnt make happy gilmore funnier movie 
 doesnt really add genuine emotional depth either 
 fact motive almost totally irrelevant movie 
 sandlers philosophy seems token gesture make nice gesture 
 endlessly refreshing 
 wedding singer sandler right track 
 fact hes wedding singer superficially relevant story 
 kind wedding singer even less important 
david spade filled role cynicism sarcasm 
 make fun fat ugly embarrassing people meets weddings story intact 
 sandler instead brings mature goodness character 
 seems really enjoy people weddings treats though family 
robbie hart sandler doesnt just sing weddings also gets loners join fun smooths someone something embarrassing 
 exactly man want wedding 
 day comes robbie wedding stood heavymetal bride movie set 
robbie takes hard 
 doesnt sleep doesnt eat gets punched work sings love stinks wedding 
julia drew barrymore waitresses weddings town gives shoulder cry ear talk 
eventually robbie starts rebounding toward julia 
 really likes shes engaged 
 fianc selfconfident jerk see trend nope just formula doesnt deserve robbie depressed fight hand 
julia seems like robbie cant leave seemingly safe stable fianc offchance robbie might serious 
 know story 
youve seen million times 
theres always new way tell new lovers new chemistry new details story 
 sometimes works 
 wedding singer works 
first chemistry sandler barrymore effective 
actually much chemistry two ones romantic tension 
sandler captures forlorn sleepwalking look jilted man struck unattainable love 
barrymore charming girl next door looking someone serious settle 
sparks dont fly kiss seem right 
second love mature 
 driven passionate sexual attraction theyre cute couple neither sandler barrymore centerfold material 
instead looking someone meaningful someone settle someone grow old 
 wedding robbie comforts kid throwing dumpster julia sits 
 repulsing situation taken stride two already parents caring sick child 
 s soundtrack references play big part movie 
 critics liked movie part s soundtrack 
 liked spite soundtrack 
often music references felt forced 
 example robbie tells exfianc get van halen tshirt jinx band break 
 ha ha ha 
get 
david lee roth leave van halen 
 sammy allen covert robbies chauffeur friend shows party wearing michael jackson jacket get single silver glove 
 thats exactly mj used wear time 
unfortunately making fun generalizations past era easy rewarding 
thats say movie isnt funny 
screenwriter tim herlihy written sandler billy madison happy gilmore two make good combination 
herlihy knows sort jokes sandler good tailored script straightfaced smartaleck style 
lets hope herlihy sandler stick together projects movie really won 
 barrymores charm sandlers heart hard go wrong
