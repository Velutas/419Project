 times success particular film depends entirely one actors effort 
often single performance can turn might rather mediocre movie something worthwhile 
 one comes along usually try think many people put work movie way one person possible carry entire project shoulders 
 sometimes simply explanation case hurricane 
 biopic falsely convicted boxer rubin hurricane carter normally called norman jewisons hurricane per tradition referring film belonging director 
 though decent work jewison claim ownership hurricane one reason film works name denzel washington 
washington plays carter boxer convicted latenight shooting bar 
jailed years maintained never committed crimes remained jail second trial countless appeals 
 situation changed group canadians moved washington worked freeing carter 
 efforts group carters lawyers eventually freed case heard federal court judge ruled rubin carter unfairly convicted 
 film details carters childhood jail efforts racist cop dan hedaya 
 finally got prison good carter became rising star middleweight pro boxer seemingly career track police framed multiple homicide 
despite efforts political activists celebrities remained imprisoned 
flash forward lesra vicellous reon shannon young africanamerican boy living group canadian tutors reads book carter wrote prison 
 book entitled sixteenth round opens young lesras eyes injustice carters life vows help free incarcerated boxer 
lesra convinces canadian friends deborah unger liev schreiber john hannah work towards goal 
 hurricane leans denzel washington 
 must carry virtually every scene sheer force will brilliantly 
 probably accurate say washington embody rubin carter plays character far stronger nobler real person hope 
 perhaps accurate say washington embodies character rubin cartera fictional personality invented solely film 
 actors work masterful washington throws every moment refusing keep audience arms length 
 feel everything feels humiliation return prison fighting hard make something life pain order wife give fight utter despair feels coming conclusion hope lost 
washingtons performance weight emotional depth 
 doesnt merely play angry happy sad feels deepest level 
 work masterful half film realized scene watching nearly affecting hands another actor 
norman jewison directs film reasonably good job pacing shot selection 
 hurricane moves quickly scene drawn much necessary narrative galloping along nicely 
jewison handles multiple flashbacks well audience always aware just time place scene nothing terribly confusing 
 boxing scenes constructed clear inspiration raging bull get inside action well believable real sports footage 
jewison puts together particularly nice scene utilizing pretty cool trick carter sent solitary confinement days refuses wear prison uniform jewison assisted wonderful acting game washington shows carter gradually starts lose mind constant solitude eventually get three rubin carters arguing one cell 
jewisons best achievement hurricane succeeding showing carter becomes embittered man hardknock life able break bitterness learn trust people 
sadly though films chief failures lie screenplay goodbutnotgreat efforts round pike winter 
 much interest viewer hurricane seems every time film gets chance take clich d route possible 
take look supporting characters example drawn either entirely good entirely evil 
carter lesra played nicely shannon deserves credit real people everyone else stereotype 
 canadians good 
 cops bad 
 canadians spend time dolefully grinning loveydovey commune commune despite films failure make clear every racist cop especially dan hedayas melts shadows glowers every black person enters room 
much dialogue comes rather hokey hate put prison 
loves gonna bust big courtroom climax everyone gets make impassioned speech lifted madefortv lifetime special 
 bad 
 cast game director job subject matter interesting script takes safer slightly boring route far often 
 wanted real reason cop hold grudge carter hes racist pig 
 wanted evidence canadians real people faults virtues instead bunch saintly crusaders looking justice 
 short wanted see film less distorted lens 
criticism levied liberties hurricane takes truth really happened carter much deserved 
 example film gives us boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello screwed judges ruled giardello winner 
 accounts fight however carter losing fairly 
furthermore much carters criminal past conveniently left film just convicted second trial never really explained 
 course hurricane works mainly fable digressions truth can excused least partially even dismissing issues dont remove one fact hurricane highly flawed film 
 one actor made schmaltzy predictable picture like work well good thing hurricane actor 
carter quoted saying denzel washington making look good hes one 
washington makes film look good 
denzel washingtons hurricane 
sounds pretty good
