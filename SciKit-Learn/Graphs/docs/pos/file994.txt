plot movie takes place one day 
 rookie cops narcotics training alongside seasoned police veteran 
 rookie doesnt know much street justice older cop teaches way things work real world 
 even cops like bend rules break law every now order catch really bad guys 
critique pretty intense little movie solid acting across board ups downs thrilling ending despite couple small flaws 
 really enjoyed movie followed two extreme characters put situations wondering place 
 film gets right dirty side well 
dirt streets proceeds teach rookie cop us audience things really work 
 course receiving lesson man put away lot scum time things seems arent exactly upandup either 
 therein lies fun film 
 agree need break small laws order put away people break really big ones 
well film moves along given two points view respect predicament sides made sense point another 
 gotta give lot credit screenplay director builds film wonderfully darkness day leading darkness script two actors deliver parts spades 
hawke first rarely plays commercial roles perfectly vulnerable side feeling bastard right top 
 denzel well can say mr washington hasnt already said 
 comes per usual highlevel style gives audience completely different side talent personally like see 
hes nice hes nice hes smart hes smart hes caring hes dog way 
 problems film included redundant nature whole thing point okay get 
 nasty order deal nasty people move one really major coincidence involved bathtub saved day one character seemed little convenient taste 
 also never really understood washingtons character got certain dire predicament seen driving car next scene 
 obviously small flaws didnt taint overall enjoyment tense drama film gets right streets nooks crannies moral dilemma lies justice system daytoday drug busts 
see want wrestle issues see want see denzel ethan strike palpable chemistry onscreen see like holding seathandles real tight movie 
 fact see scene ethan hawke plays cards host gangbangers alone dang now thats intense 
wheres joblo coming 
 corruptor crimson tide l confidential lethal weapon requiem dream seven shaft traffic
