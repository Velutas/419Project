 muse albert brooks sixth film writerdirectoractor cowrote monica johnson although good movie level best works defending life mother 
 problem lies script movie relies dialogue humor arent nearly many laughs chuckles despite good oneliners 
 great premise doesnt deliver full potential 
 like albert brooks film think can identify steven phillips little bit 
 may whine complain just wants support family happy 
 like sharon stone movie nice change pace 
 also enjoyed cameos featuring likes rob reiner james cameron martin scorsese 
 although muse doesnt much say hollywood robert altmans player still left theater feeling good 
 thats something wish got movies
