 desperate measures something excited seeing back originally scheduled released summer 
 reason delayed hollywoods traditional dumping ground january 
now see real reason delay simple yet highly entertaining film 
michael keaton stars maniacial murderer whos bone marrow can save life dying son san francisco police detective garcia 
keaton agrees transplant can attempt escape 
 succeeds plan course work movies 
 police force now trying kill keaton garcia working trying keep keaton alive order save son 
 film definately flaws 
 plot strictly tv movie week fare acting direction certainly boost far status 
also keatons escape garcias captain barks many men die save kids life 
 film treats evil insignificant remark 
 thing vaild point 
 many people needlessly crippled burned killed just save one child 
whats greater good 
many lives one life 
 movies really guts nowadays loved seen movie come final choice garcias character 
place situation knows kill keaton keaton kill someone else 
alas movies days generally ambition pull audiences strings ways might make uncomfortable 
despite silly moments one two really stupid ones good things desperate measures outnumber bad 
 main highlight keatons performance 
 character easily overacting scene chewing freak keaton underplays nicely 
hes menacing pacific heights even menacing batman yes kids batman used dark character certainly get idea hes evil 
even final scene film normally just hate seems strangely appropriate film 
 much didnt mind slightest 
 another bonus film takes place san francisco usually means car chase hills youve seen billion times 
 moment looked though happen 
 doesnt thats creative
