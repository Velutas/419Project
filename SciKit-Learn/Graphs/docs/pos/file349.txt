bob happy bastards quickie review 
 matrix 
whats worse yk 
 fully digital future nothing real 
thats computer programmer neo keanu reeves slowly learns enters dangerous world matrix movie directed wachowski brothers guys behind hip thriller bound 
 groan presence reeves lead role hold 
theres actually story depth 
 seems group hackers stop system matrix led bald brilliant laurence fishburne assisted carrie ann moss looks quite cool leather must say 
neo reeves pretty much key player fight although really doesnt look first 
 amateur one fisburne thinks 
credit wachowskis putting together great story allows suspense build something special effectsladen films seem days 
theres plenty effects go around course least theres backbone build well 
reeves surprisingly good role neo particularly fight scene fishburne comes across goofy yet great 
 wish villains werent quite generic leftover gmen looking sweet scifi actioner plenty stopmotion swooping camera angles course motherlode helicopter explosion 
now wachowskis headed horror films next project 
bring
