 seem two reactions dark city 
 either love unimpressed 
count love 
 good crow spawn dark city better 
 former two specific comicbook following latter original work potential broader appeal 
 similar look others dark city much thoughtful much less violent 
 clever complex story still fascinating like selection twilight zone 
 man rufus sewell awakened bathtub man syringe 
surprised attacker runs 
 dazed man gets tub finds womans body room 
 mysterious caller warns leave apartment immediately packs clothes leaves never sure hes leaving hes fleeing 
ghoulish figures long coats recognize man chase dark city hounding like figures nightmare 
 odd blast willpower allows man dream free pursuers long enough check d 
 amnesiac learns dreaming name john murdoch 
now remember rest life 
dark city good many levels 
first look movie excellent 
give credit production designers george liddle patrick tatopolous creating coherent look diverse elements 
 visual elements american ss mixed dickensera urban industrial elements 
 pulled together sad dark look reminiscent diner edward hoppers painting nighthawks 
proyas use models gives appropriately eerie unreality films world audience see city model ghouls 
 look like cross tim burtons batman bleak animation brothers quay 
second editing film good 
 pacing track plot revealed amnesia explained satisfying increments 
also stylized editing within scene gives movie tense caffeinated look 
third special effects well used 
 look good importantly right effects used right job 
one example stands mind coated figures haunt city can attack telekinetically 
 simple ripple effect used 
 showy effect chosen just gratuitous 
restraint shown necessary letting critical effects look impressive 
finally like gattaca dark city spends just little effort striving mythical significance 
unlike gattaca story just openended nonliteral enough successful 
john murdochs recovery amnesia tied passing night hopeful coming dawn 
 struggle amnesia figuratively literally struggle mankind least world 
 finally see big picture movies world mysterious iroquois image world carried back giant turtle 
 minor flaws keep giving movie perfect score roger ebert gave strongly recommend look pace story timelessness
