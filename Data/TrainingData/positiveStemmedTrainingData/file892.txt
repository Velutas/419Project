 daylight sylvester stallone breaks new ground cinematically speaking covers familiar territory quite well 
yesterday going business university bookstore noticed stand daylight movie posters

rob cohen previously brought us films dragon bruce lee story recently dragonheart gee wonder likes dragons reason 
 think now brings us nicely executed disaster picture fx industrial light magic aftereffects explosion collapses busy tunnel new york new jersey 
sylvester stallone plays kit latura essentially carbon copy character played cliffhanger paramedic outs made mistake got people killed 
 crisis hits right place right time takes upon go get everybody 
 similarities cliffhanger perhaps real difference cliffhanger villain daylights bad guy mother nature 
 fact two movies made hong kong might titled cliffhanger iiit bears relationship film hk film sequels predecessors 
 first halfhour daylight setup 
subplots woven mechanism disaster assembled 
 meet important people toxic waste disposal truck drivers young frustrated jilted rejected playwright family struggling stay together older couple dog truckload prisoners ad agency executive tunnel police officer stallone others
