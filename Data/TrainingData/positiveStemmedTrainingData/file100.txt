call touched demon 
gregory hoblits fallen serial killer movie unusual horrific twist 
 marketed properly film crossover appeal appreciate supernatural tales like prophesy crave grim dark thrillers like silence lambs seven 
 fact theres even little twin peaks found albeit lions share weirdness distilled 
 remember bob 
 biggest failing fallen although consistently interesting always edgy suspenseful one might hope 
 serial killer elias koteas loose philadephia detective john hobbes denzel washington noblest man police force brought justice 
now last hours death row awaiting inevitable date gas chamber mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes goes around really goes around 
shortly thereafter begins sing time side hes taken last walk 
minutes later state pennsylvania carried execution edgar reese dead 
 hobbes nightmare just beginning reese wasnt normal psychopath host body mythical dark angel named azazel 
 reeses death azazel free hop body body murdering wreaking havoc will 
 hobbes pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz inkling theyre 
 rest cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini newcomer department lieutenant stanton donald sutherland dont clue result mortal danger 
 depicted hoblit primal fear cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia dark dreary place gothic city rather modern one 
 skyscrapers monoliths current architecture technology shown 
 famous landmark appear isnt liberty bell independence hall genos steaks 
shadows night scenes abound 
 days cloudy unpromising 
 kind setting easy believe fallen angels walk among men 
fallens plot brimming potential realized 
somehow expected frightening tale emerge something kind premise 
 level terror like gore kept check 
nevertheless several creepily effective scenes spirit azazel moves body body people bump crowded city sidewalks 
 film also boasts chase sequence kind can best described unusual 
 several dozen actors play azazel best far elias koteas exotica crash despite screen ten minutes gives fantastically charged performance 
john goodman also seems enjoying although role film relegated burly sidekick 
sadly however two ones excel 
everyone else including denzel washington boring 
washingtons flat performance disappointing surprise film 
 hes bad per se hes interesting 
theres real sense vulnerability desperation way portrays character keeps us distanced however slightly hobbes 
 circumstances become progressively dire cop lifeordeath chess game azazel approaches point checkmate expected edge seat 
washingtons subdued approach part reason never felt sense urgency 
however least washington believable can said embeth davidtz schindlers list donald sutherland 
 fair flaws characters arent actingrelated neither stanton gretta milano wellwritten 
 said however theres nothing inspired either davidtzs sutherlands work 
 appear sleepwalking way parts know contribution film one advancing plot rather developing multidimensional individual 
narratively fallen glaring weaknesses 
although plot proceeds convoluted gamelike structure uses denzel washingtonsupplied voiceover overexplain matters 
 times actually helpful use beyond obvious occasions ponderous lines like like night sometimes come face face become little hard swallow 
 addition fallen saddled kind disgustingly bland generic theology embraced numerous movies tv shows like touched angel 
however despite negatives im still recommending fallen strength complex plot especially ending loved 
 final scenes startling audacious unexpected 
 often plot development takes surprise way one 
 time movies fall apart last ten minutes fallen manages buck trend redeem 
 great motion picture considering bad january releases reasonably entertaining way spend two hours 
 whatever dont walk film end credits begun roll
