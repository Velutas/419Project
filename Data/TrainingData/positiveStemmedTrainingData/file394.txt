plot odin great high school basketball player 
hes dating hot girl coach loves ass 
 fact coach even admits fatherly feelings towards 
unfortunately coachs real son hugo isnt pleased hear 
 fact doesnt like hearing odins triumphs generally supersede 
 set 
well lets just say starts mess peoples heads one thing leads another thing leads well 
youll see 
critique powerful thoroughly depressing wellacted nonteen movie starring bunch teens 
credit director tim blake nelson creating modern day version shakespearian classic set realistic high school environment basketball championships backdrop impending sense doom core 
 also give actors film turn convincing performances taking characters ups downs 
hartnett especially applauded taking despicable character dude just want grab throat beat shit sign good actor ask 
phifer also comes play movie nice blend charisma fear love anger spread character 
 always guys side definitely felt sorry things moved along 
julia stiles also good character wasnt much different others shes played recently 
 however surprised martin sheens showing since hadnt taken seriously actor past years 
 character definitely overthetop film appreciated fervor rage ultimate blind desire win 
 great example workaholic man see trees forest 
 reservations movie though 
first gangsta hiphop music used pretty much every scene transition 
 cute first became little obvious annoying times 
 film also edited pretty choppily like 
 scenes cut one cleaned afterwards 
 also didnt like fact hartnetts character man behind much nastiness goes film infallible 
 words pretty much everything says asks someone happens automatically without goofups 
 mean know guy smart appreciated little realism circumstances 
 overall movie will devastate 
 fun date movie 
 movie high school basketball team black star falls white girl side tracks 
 jealousy love envy fury passion revenge pretty much negative thought thats ever passed head 
 worth seeing 
oh definitely 
 pun intended moving picture great performances shakespearian speak thank god outstanding directorial job nelson 
 final scene alone enough send massive chill spine especially impressed directors choice music near end 
 fact whole sequence quite reminiscent final showdown scene taxi driver guess thats saying something right 
wheres joblo coming 
 things hate election hamlet loves labors lost natural born killers save last dance shakespeare love
