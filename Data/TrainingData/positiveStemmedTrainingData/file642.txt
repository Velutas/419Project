john sayles men guns happens society brute force constant threat violence means gaining maintaining power 
 film takes place unnamed central american country men guns rulers 
 country divided tiny segments controlled guerrillas guns controlled army soldiers guns spaces inbetween controlled thieves bandits terrorists 
 people fitting one descriptions defined powerlessness 
however like many central american countries one also features modernity 
 unnamed capital city bears hallmarks contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc might well another country live comforts city either decided ignore violence ravaging rest land else simply ignorant 
 films main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls latter category 
one patients army general describes educated man ever met also naive 
fuentes true liberal caring man thinks can cure ills country fighting bacteria ignorance among indigenous indians 
 government assistance trained large group eager young medical students sent rainforest cure educate 
 program legacy repeats good idea 
however ventures rainforest visit prot g s finds things turned envisioned 
 travels deeper forest going village village story always doctors killed either guerrillas army soldiers usually helping 
 dr fuentes asks village woman army killed one doctors replies simply guns didnt 
rational science attempts cure wiped men guns others sickness ignorance helps maintain power 
dr fuentes picks several companions journey characterized loss 
first young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez neither mother father 
next fuentes crosses paths thief named domingo dami n delgado deserted army tired jeered committing murderous atrocities 
 ordeal army domingo lost selfrespect defines pistol 
along way group also picks padre portillo dami n alc zar priest lost faith 
 domingo running army portillo labeled guerrilla sympathizer ran away village preaching

sayles two major strengths director characters setting abundantly evident men guns 
 like many films sayles might tightened one somewhat editing room longerthannecessary running time sin almost always committed director also editor 
 creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes domingo 
 uneasy relationship also somewhat humorous context films overarching theme violence power domingos attempts control fuentes revolver constantly undermined fuentes belief revolver unloaded first later isnt 
 setting also thick detail rainforest 
sayles knows bring location life whether early twentiethcentury coal mining town matewan contemporary texasmexico bordertown lone star 
sayles particularly inventive director likes let actors work cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke beauty danger central american terrain 
sayles also maintains strong sense authenticity filming everything location mexico using latin american actors dialogue spoken either spanish native indian dialects 
 one exception couple bumbling american tourists work comic relief evidence just clueless united states going hundred miles south texas border 
 stretch say men guns depressing film 
 fact two feelings evokes hopelessness failure 
 addition loss main characters also failures something whether dr fuentes failure change anything medicine padre portillos inability stand martyr always dreamed 
nevertheless bleak material sayles chosen deals accordingly 
 last shot film offer hint hope even world one character puts nobody refuses men guns
