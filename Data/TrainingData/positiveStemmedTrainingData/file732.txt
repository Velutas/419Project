 scenes alone quite impressive fascinating harrowing 
yet seven just technical accomplishment 
 addition style fincher supplies substance 
seven compelling characters wants us know understand fincher ties together completely pessimistic view society 
detective william somerset morgan freeman man nearly given world 
 easy see 
 world doesnt make sense 
 somerset drives point home rather ghastly story robbery victim attacked just blocks police precinct 
 knocked robbed wallet attacker stabbed helpless man eyes 
 somerset believe following murder investigation picking pieces will able catch killer 
somersets new partner david mills brad pitt given world perhaps still young perhaps optimism hes naive films portrayal world 
 completely disagrees somersets abandonment hope

 theres one character underlines message seven trying convey killer john doe kevin spacey 
sevens payoff lies ability allow us see killer views world drives 
one important thing remember doe easy simply dismiss psycho motives behind slayings 
 exactly mistake mills makes 
 extremely intense superbly performed closing scenes allowed see doe mind merely product society

besides stylistic largerissue arguments seeing film recommend seven also slick wellmade thriller 
 features exciting plot developments commanding performances lots suspense conclusion chilling riveting quite unfair 
 cruel world
