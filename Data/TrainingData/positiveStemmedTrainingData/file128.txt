urban legend surprised 
based last films genre produced including exclusive likes know last summer disturbing behavior disappointing halloween h positive store another mildly entertaining silly ultimately boring rehash scream phenomena 
thankfully legend rose soggy premise become hip scary stylish entertainment also will probably become one best films year 
youre familiar plot bunch overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered masked maniac whos identity revealed closing moments film turns guessed everybodys favorite veteran whodunit flicks 
 person didnt suspect 
however just legend doesnt really break new ground far literary even technical achievements go mean cant qualify firstclass entertainment 
 believe one funnest times ive movies year 
 thing im really sure made particular stab pardon pun genre seem fresh alive 
maybe abovepar performances movies two leads jared leto cybil actress alicia witt 
 target direction jamie blanks 
 likely though inspired premise 
 dont think need tell killer hacking people ala urban folklore much frightening killer fisherman 
urban legend begins sequence reminded classic scream opener much plotting attention detail makes absolutely chilling teaser rest film 
 pretty young coed driving deserted road gasp gas problem heehee forces stop equally deserted gas station refill 
one problem though 
 want stop station run brad dourif 
 thought 
predictably attendant ends coaxing main building sort problem credit card company 
 odd though pick phone realize nobodys line 
naturally potential victim escapes car drives 
 least expect whack 
 decapitation 
 turns creepy looking attendant just trying warn maniac back seat car 
 time 
 obvious candidate slightly offkilter professor college girl went none freddy kruger robert englund teaches class urban legends 
aha 
 famehungry local journalist leto looking meaty story put resume 
like movies nature one chief pleasures trying guess whodunit 
 turns course one didnt suspect 
im going pretend urban legend anything must give credit credit due 
 flick definitely deserves credit many recent horror films fun
