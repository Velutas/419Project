 soft spot heart pure amoral sleaze 
 liked showgirls said 
 typically enjoy sitting eszterhaz sexfilled cinematic tabloidish trash 
wild things best sleazy film ive ever seen 
 filled great performances graphic sex threeway sex rape charges doublecrosses plot twists genitalia genders graphic violence death witty humor best denise richards 
criticizing film disgusting raucous just plain wrong fundamentally pointless criticizing citizen kane disturbing titanic lofty epic 
wild things film succeeds endeavors dont just admire thisi admire entertaining fun time movies 
 must admit upfront however directly center age group film engineered appeal 
 imagine shows 
 hard give plot summary without giving away pieces shouldnt known 
 thought whole thing worked trailer wrong lot turns 
ill just say film takes place blue bay rich little town florida 
 blue bay lives sam lombardo matt dillon teacher accused rape two students kelly van ryan denise richards suzie toller neve campbell 
kellys mother sandra theresa russell immediately presses charges 
 happens fairly early film 
 right point whole film predicted 
 wrong though every time proven wrong shocked 
wild things isnt even remotely plausible fun see story takes us implausibility every scene meaningless often invited just kicks 
 remember first seeing preview wild things replacement killers 
id give preview four stars 
 made want see movie much ive waiting anxiously ever since 
 past weeks though started realize way film live preview see independence day thankfully proven wrong 
 preview film one needs studied marketing analysts every distribution company make us want see film doesnt give away secrets 
 im talk preview 
im talk denise richards 
now found mildly interesting starship troopers wild things appeals base instinct every scene shes demands attention way almost performer can 
 course might something oceanic eyes 
flawless body 
 thought great job acting stop laughing 
 richards truly findshe talented always convincing film 
 mixed insane physical appeal makes vital asset film may grace future 
 actors good 
dillon suave ever nice see bouncing back albino alligator 
bacon good job acting determined stuff sex crimes officer 
neve campbell gives layered performance though wont pretend characters deep complex 
 plot like work people insane basically contrived 
thats okay director john mcnaughton knows hes making selfconsciously wicked film 
 sceneeven threeway sex sceneis observed hilarity mcnaughton result sleazefest thats smart resist 
 isnt inconsistent moment wild things every bit alluring garbage trashy funny entertaining painful 
 loved
