altman worked just every conceivable genre westerns epic dramas comedies 
 matter genre always sure give altman stamp usually consists kinds idiosyncratic quirks little details often missed without repeat viewings 
 gingerbread man different although style much restrained 
however without little touches film easily slumped routine actionthriller 
 great deal credit films success can given actors especially branagh rarely works outside period pieces direction 
 british actor consistently maintains serviceable southern drawl making essentially contemptible character interesting sympathetic 
rick extremely flawed man branaugh brings real humanity character 
without entire film fall flat much reliant audience feeling ricks pain frustration 
 supporting actors also put fine performances including embeth davidtz probably best known heartbreaking role jewish maid schindlers list 
tom berenger provides gruff comic relief robert duvall spends onscreen time just looking weird 
 doesnt seem like much little spoken dialogue watch closely films one courtroom scene entire performance eyes body language actors pulled without either silly overbearing 
 gingerbread man isnt league altmans greatest works like nashville player nonetheless solid piece genre filmmaking may prove successful vehicle restart somewhat lagging career 
 critics love stamp films like commercial altman can maintain artistic integrity films aimed tiny audience dont make money 
altman done something much better took generic movie investing artistry effort made something
