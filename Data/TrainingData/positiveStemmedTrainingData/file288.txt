im beginning get fed 
 four years critic thing kept going moderate balance films 
 good balances bad 
 try see equal proportions 
 disneys mighty joe young remake marks fourth week havent seen truly terrible movie 
 backwards machismo suppose urge see things loathe need see bad film every 
 know mighty joe young doesnt qualify 
far bad mighty joe young actually family fun movie 
 enjoyable appropriate cute cuddly things ive seeing every movie since bugs life 
mighty joe young tracks pound gorilla wilds africa taken reserve 
california 
 
 safekeeping 
okay 
 little unrealistic ever said kids movie slightest hint realism 
 first half movie gorillas mistesque hatred poachers womanofthewild motif 
 second half straight parody king kong awestruck onlookers 
mark one 
im feeling relaxed 
 point fact extremely uncreative movie 
 vetern can say quite honestly creativity doesnt count much 
 saves mighty joe wrath although colleagues cohorts surely bashing film moment 
 film take girl date

 youre right alongside kid normal rights wrongs slip away 
 thing happens watch horror movie action flick 
 becomes fun 
 enjoy mighty joe young shut watch
