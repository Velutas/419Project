 doesnt pretend deep doesnt weigh long expositions intricate studies characters basically just cute movie vein chocolat pay forward amazing visuals incredibly nice intentions chocolat somehow able nab oscar nomination best picture last year sham many different levels might well slap film consideration also since quite bit better much original former 
one thing film isnt though least according best film year bestowed honor best least different film festivals far year

thankfully film doesnt bog much stuff actually goes way invent new ways shoot scenes integrate moments fantasy fabric transport audience inside imagination kindhearted french girl 
 whole lot fun carries beautiful message love support fellow man 
 lead audrey tautou perfect role gives enough moments truth develop character someone care end film 
unfortunately rest cast isnt welldeveloped even though pretty appealing couple couldve left save time least one left stranded plotwise films end happened guy caf spying exgirlfriend whole movie
