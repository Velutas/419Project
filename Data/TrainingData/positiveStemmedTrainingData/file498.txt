theres movies enjoy even though know probably shouldnt difficult time trying explain 
 lucky numbers perfect example blatant ripoff fargo every movie based elmore leonard novel yet somehow still works 
 know im minority let explain 
 film takes place harrisburg pa unseasonably warm winter 
john travolta plays local bigshot tv weatherman idolized townsfolk john travolta bumbling russ richards 
russ married crystal lisa kudrow blonde bimbo ever one history cinema 
shes selfish nasty bitch full lust desire somehow got job lottery ball girl exactly intellectually taxing job market 
crystals cheating russ collective boss dick ed oneil tv station manager 
 doesnt seem genuinely like either can onehorse town 
much like fargo movie tells story man whos going broke pull huge scam get rich quick 
 enlists help english friend gig tim roth local stripclub owner tells fix lottery 
along way subplot involving twobit thug named accurately dale thug michael rappaport gets mixed process 
theres also bookie somehow gets thrown mix deal goes 
im going elaborate much plot story continues unwind take twists turns youre expecting 
 farce basically straightforward adultoriented comedy doesnt go far classic black comedy 
 fargo sometimes shocking disturbing funny lucky numbers just funny cant take characters outrageous situations seriously 
 big cartoon basically funny can respect 
travolta great role even though hes really likable character hes trying nice guy despite fact hes creep 
hes like gangster morals genuinely feels sorry guys kill 
crystal just opposite shes constantly arguing using whatever brain cells left look 
kudrow perfect role since shes spent years tv dimwitted phoebe friends 
 character basically evil incarnation phoebe 
 admit honestly surprised pleased plot unraveled methods main characters use try get share money 
like jackie brown elmore leonard adaption story circle characters lottery money won illegally 
 screenplay fine job balancing characters slowly revealing motivations hidden agendas time keep russ richards main focus 
 characters introduced since film iconic cartoony atmosphere can take faith just makes minor characters 
 ending great 
 surprising funny makes feel good 
 realize film packed different movies worth stories two hours time didnt fall apart although many critics might beg differ 
 liked see isnt makes movie good
