nosferatu vampyre germany 
 film review mike watson copyright mike watson 
 extraordinary retelling bram stokers dracula german filmmaker werner herzog deserves prominent places cinematic vampire lore 
inspired f w murnaus silent film name herzogs film work exquisite bleakness oddly touching tragedy beautiful uniquely haunting quality lingers long afterwards 
 original fulllength english german language versions nosferatu last received video release u s distributor anchor bay entertainment gorgeous widescreen prints 
 now shortened english language version film available video europe 
 rereleases restore film full length viewers still wary english version due often stilted dialogue 
apparently english dialogue coach herzog set filming incompetent voices also seem dubbed 
 german version english subtitles remains definitive one 
everyone knows story dracula 
 
 story bastardised film years brief reminder basic plot certainly wont hurt 
jonathan harker young lawyer sent gloomy castle dracula transylvania business creepy count played klaus kinski wants buy house harkers hometown 
upon seeing photo harkers wife radiant isabelle adjani instantly falls love 
locking harker castle sets long journey meet woman whose beauty bewitches 
upon divining identity vampire adjani seduces count lures death one morning sun rises 
 story familiar millions herzog elevated stokers tale realm use term tad reluctantly cinematic art 
nosferatu much meditation film shot blueish white filters peopled characters perform half hypnotised 
 films surreal dreamlike quality utterly mesmerising 
 much enjoy ill limit praise key points 
holding film together kinskis remarkable performance count dracula 
past screen portrayals including bela lugosis famous turn largely one dimensional tended towards camp 
 kinski oh boy something far compelling 
aided startling makeup job portrays draculas vampirism simply pure evil sort loathsome disease 
 man dreadfully lonely 
 lives utter solitude shunned locals hideous appearance reputation bloodlust 
kinskis portrayal count creepy deeply affecting 
 dies almost feel mans tortured soul freed last 
 theres unforgettable soundtrack largely composed german group popul vuh 
 eerily beautiful evocative quite impossible imagine film without 
popul vuh longtime herzog collaborators play ancientsounding kind spacemusic using piano chants exotic instruments 
 first saw film years ago impressed tracked bought number albums 
 one still listen tantric songs music nosferatu taken 
 testament musics depth powerful without pictures 
 album still available highly respected ambient world music label celestial harmonies
