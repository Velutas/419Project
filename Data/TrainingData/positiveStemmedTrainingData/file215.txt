capsule suprisingly comedy straight action flick isnt necessarily bad thing 
 exactly oscar caliber one helluva bulletriddled good time 
extended review know remember hitmen evil murderous scum 
alas times achangin 
 recent string movies hitmen suddenly wise cracking funloving killerswithhearts 
 brings us hong kong director kirk wongs first american feature big hit 
oddly enough time last year similar film grosse point blank released 
advertised quirky comedy hints action turned suprising dosage 
 big hit quite opposite 
 hyped new film producer john woo one expect lots stylized killing action 
however theres sore lack thing wrong big hit 
 film starts mel smiley cohorts job white slaver 
mel played mark wahlberg dopey milquetoast role killing machine flips spins even breakdances whilst popping caps 
sadly doesnt get chance much 
except beginning set piece last twenty minutes film comedy mode 
 action least prime cut stuff 
wong numerous hong kong features makes quite nice u s debut 
however pacing bit action sequences bookending movie lasting long enough 
 start electrifying fresh just kinda stop 
normally hamper movie point unenjoyable 
luckily ben ramseys screenplay bitingly funny piece work 
 problem might much humor one joke makes laugh hard miss next 
 best gags include oriental film maker luck one mels hitmen pals just discovered onanism 
 problem minor characters handled laugh sometimes works sometimes doesnt 
overall big hit may flaws makes stylishly directed gutwrenchingly funny joyride 
definately one better ways spend two hours
