zero effect gets title main character daryl zero bill pullman although dont understand truly means last line dialogue film 
zero private investigator perhaps best private investigator ever lived least hed like think 
however hes socially inept eccentric every possible way fact certainly makes talents private eye even bewildering already 
zeros accomplice steve arlo ben stiller normal guy business side job hes one actually speaks clients explains zeros greatness investigator 
 opening scene steve explaining many virtues zeros talents soontobe client gregory stark ryan oneal 
 turns stark lost key safe deposit box now blackmailed something apparently knows nothing 
zero takes case plot thickens 
 path leads young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens 
despite luminous seeminglyharmless presence turns one blackmailing stark 
 investigations zero learns without developing feelings gloria feelings reclusive behavior new confusing 
 particular affinity towards mystery genre film 
 can idly enjoy movies private investigators every film like chinatown comes long blows away actually private eye film ever reached chinatowns greatness 
zero effect jake kasdans first effort writerdirector film private investigator succeeds attempts original funny completely involving motion picture 
 many cliches available genre find amazing kasdan avoided 
 didnt just successfully avoid flaws created great film one interested fascinated first shot final moment 
take starters great cast characters 
pullman terrific zero showing comic flair really havent seen since spaceballs 
zero kind guy seems ease switching personalities frequently fact hes almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside profession difficult believe 
pullmans performance much layered might seem first glance occasional voiceover hes going motions job insightful often hilarious 
ben stiller also funny individual hes kind comedian makes normal lines sound funny 
 ill shoot says stark one point 
 gun everything 
 character also welldrawn interesting subplot involving girlfriend angela featherstone happy extensive amounts time must spend away due unpredictability job 
oneal also gives character bit depth kim dickens last seen underused mercury rising gets chance show us talent giving gloria realism kind character really needs 
 find zero effect immensely funny witty film 
kasdans humor best kind soft spoken mostly dialoguedriven though great visual jokes 
 kind humor thats funny even youve seen five six times 
theres one scene zero talks detached makes great detective 
 see narration various shots sitting bed standing motionlessly hair destroyed utterly blank look painted unshaven face eyes pointing something camera obviously nothing particular 
 cant convey funny makes great film making point scenes like frequent provide solid characterization zero 
 side note dont consider average viewer comes comedy sound elitist find things funny many vice versa 
 clump people near theater laughing uproariously film rest theater relatively silent 
 feeling humor wont appeal everyone theres certainly enough story character development keep anyones interest 
jake kasdan son writerdirector lawrence kasdan years old 
 found seeing film cant remember ever impressed film maker 
 direction stylish without pretentious writing mature full developed 
zero effect kind film ill buy collection smart original films like rare one actually heart soul 
 end film involved characters satisfied outcome 
 kasdans undeniable talent young age can hope see lot future
