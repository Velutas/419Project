opinion good news movie happy ending features guy trying right thing 
director francis ford coppola film little differently stereotypical law movie 
 typical lawyer movie theres one big case movie focuses solving somewhere along line surprise witnesses motives turn good guy wins lots gripping courtroom drama 
however coppolas movie deliberately low key 
 rainmaker plays like personality sketch young rudy gets emotionally involved tries save various little quirky side characters 
 background rudys voice narrates feelings makes halfcynical jokes legal profession general 
two factors combine make movie less heavy can 
first rudys time split juggling three cases rather concentrating single highstakes case 
also rudys use voice narration place acting makes film lose dramatic edge 
 end result entertaining low key law movie good guys win rudy narrates way coming age
