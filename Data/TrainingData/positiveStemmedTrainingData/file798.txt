 seen several many woody allen movies 
 didnt particulary like radio days purple rose cairo play sam 
 quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery everything 
sex loved might aphrodite 
however found bullets broadway snoozing bore 
 bullets got raving reviews didnt think id like 
 finally saw double feature ready wear think hated 
since 
 love also seems getting raving reviews wasnt sure id want see 
thankfully 
people burst singing dancing something hardly ever like 
 movie infectious 
 funny 
 entertaining 
 unlike evita sing need 
sure actors may great singers seems great time audience 
thats say 
really think going dull movie youre probably dead 
 dead people forced movie theatres 
 mark leeper dead 
 said almost ghastly misfire 
 movie rated r one use word motherf
