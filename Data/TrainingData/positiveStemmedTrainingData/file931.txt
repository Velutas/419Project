 works art almost impossible review complexity legendary status prevents reviewer say anything original 
one masterpieces casablanca probably best film history seventh art definitely popular one 
 popularity can measured multitude less disguised remakes made half century since premiere also countless tributes references movie makers use works day 
casablanca also movie rare virtue praised critics loved general audience 
one things makes film even unique fact doomed fail least judging conventional moviemaking wisdom time 
 based broadway play mediocre hadnt produced stage screenplay three writers julius g epstein philip j epstein howard koch beeing written shooting went along main actors producers second choice finally man behind camera michael curtiz considered capable great director 
however movie commercially successful earned three oscars including one best film 
 day considered best example hollywood film making golden age 
 plot movie heavily influenced needs ww propaganda yet also used rather complicated now almost forgotten political circumstances global conflict order make intriguing story 
 december casablanca exotic port atlantic coast north africa controlled officially neutral yet nazicollaborating french vichy government 
thousands refugees wartorn europe stuck way lisbon safety america ready pay price precious exit visas 
many shady characters thrive misery including corrupt police chief captain renault rains 
 best friend rick blaine bogart used idealistic antifascist now owns popular night club casablanca lives cynical philosophy sticking neck nobody 
however everything changes gets possession two precious extra visas 
 event coincides arrival two new refugees casablanca 
one victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader escaped three times nazi concentration camps became legend enslaved europe 
 accompanied beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman rick stormy affair eve nazi occupation paris 
 couple needs visas especially gestapo major strasser veidt trail 
rick now forced choose love wounded pride selfpreserving interest hatred fascism 
 casting movie seems influenced divine inspiration humphrey bogart legendary actor history cinema one rare character actors elevated persona star status 
bogarts portrayal rick complicated man torn idealistic past bitter present perfect icon forever connected character 
another icon company ingrid bergman great actress old hollywood artistic visual prime 
 cinematic coupling bogart bergman became one main symbols era filmmaking happier times romance screen didnt look childish trite like contemporary works 
 many people casablanca probably best romantic film ever made 
 reason isnt romance realistic story people forced make tough often wrong choices life 
 casting casablanca right target just case main leads 
 supporting actors also marvellous job 
sidney longstreet peter lorre mainly give mystic flavour spotted previous bogart classic john hustons maltese falcon yet managed portray colourful original characters 
another shining example good casting now almost forgotten paul henreid weakest part love triangle character victor laszlo believable charisma looks like somebody inspire millions people rise nazi tiranny 
unfortunately charisma burdened laszlo leaves little place difficult choice making character forever overshadowed rickilsa coupling 
however rick ilsa actually serious competiton memorable character casablanca 
captain renault brilliantly portrayed claude rains role lifetime embodiment perfect almost unmatched balance ethical corruption physical charm 
despite undoubtful villain almost entire movie rains managed make renault sympathetic character final conversion side good symbolized subtle gesture end movie looked unnecessary 
rains also gave another dimension movie making even ambiguous people like analyse movies death discovered signs homosexuality renaults relationship towards rick ricks final words leave room even outrageous speculations 
together welldrawn characters exciting story movie good creating atmosphere 
professional nitpickers probably field day discovering numerous historical geographical inaccuracies casablanca still shining example hollywood ww movie beliavable realistic 
 way even dont see historical document casablanca movie can source entertainment well infinite inspiration
