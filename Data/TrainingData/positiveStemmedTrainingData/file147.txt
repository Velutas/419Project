seen may p m crossgates cinema guilderland n y theater brother john 
theater rating excellent seats sound picture 
 critics note review longest ive ever written still scratches surface 
id recommend read seen film form critical analysis 
 friend fellow film critic ted prigge said review phantom menace even write review 
never mind fact ive waiting new star wars movie since seven years old 
never mind fact everyone internet already dissected discussed movie even released 
never mind theres much going movie terms plot action special effects longterm story analyze every aspect take lot time energy still wouldnt cover everything 
 also like ted reviews ill try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly reader 
 can begin analyzing specific aspects film many general significant factors must considered get specifics film skip next four paragraphs 
 made obvious last several years another trilogy films will produced account missing initial three installments star wars series first films actually episode four one 
george lucas creator series probably just assumed people know firstproduced trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy chronologically 
 media interviews past explained movies made order cant recall reasons 
 new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy err 
second trilogy 
well know mean 
 order review thorough many significant points must mentioned unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed caution 
critics note one personal policy intentionally analyze spoilers like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule 
critics note reviewing film also breaks universal critics law reviewing movies roger ebert coined movie 
 many outside factors come play films plot significance part trilogy just considering modern society difficult impossible simply review film completely autonomous story 
first catalog know film even going 
 know young anakin skywalker will grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker will lead successful revolution empire 
 know obiwan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways force attempts become jedi knight fail thus anakin fall dark side 
 also know something force kind universal force determines fate can manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel jedi 
 dont know sure history ruling galaxy likely much longer complex government earth 
 one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle definite order complexity 
also seems supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books paperbacks published years since movies ended 
 notably details regarding emperor empire jedi senator last name palpatine 
 havent kept star wars paraphernalia years still way know details simply recognizing actor voice least 
 phantom menace first chapter long saga one assume basic groundwork laid including history behind major factors series especially force jedi knights 
unfortunately film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed never explained 
 didnt liked aspect film one reasons falls just short greatness 
 youre going tell story beginning tell beginning possible trilogy complete another trilogy episodes clarify back story even 
 digress 
ive said much yet havent even touched specifics film 
 necessary disclaiming elements go show just vast story star wars series individual film 
 get movie unlike three weve come know love since late s 
 similarity films helps keep spirit series familiar time seems flaw filmmaking process since sometimes rings unoriginality 
 basic story rather sorted complex even confusing times 
 told army known trade federation set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo 
 given many details clarify back story federation purpose instead film opts get story moving quickly 
 introduced two jedi master quigon jinn neeson apprentice obiwan kenobi mcgregor 
 two acting ambassadors sort hopes ending obvious hostility federation planets queen amidala portman 
 leader federation alien called viceroy following orders strange mythical character older human man whose face body covered shadowed black robe hood wears 
 referred lord sidious considering appearance especially creepy evil voice obviously one significant characters series 
sidious communicates viceroy digital transmissions never person 
clearly actual whereabouts something wants keep secret also reveal identity never openly revealed film clear viewers 
 feeling well delve background next two films 
 doesnt take film long spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives films story begins move along 
 film doesnt one specific plot works manner films series get one miniplot adventure top another 
 many miniplotswithinplots film describe gives movie hook 
 films relied type storytelling limits technology time films screenplays also limiting 
 sense limitlessness gives phantom menace unique traits 
 already know film takes place least generation two original star wars trilogy means lot background unclear andor unexplained may cleared beginning vast epic story 
 significant storyline involving discovery yearold anakin skywalker lloyd quigon jinn introduction jedi council 
 briefly summarize story jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts queen amidalas spaceship damaged efforts free federation 
 meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn chalks will force 
jinn can feel skywalker great natural power force another subplot involving bet skywalker fantastic race will enter details significance begin reveal 
 also provides new elaboration explanation force never mentioned 
 fact seems something important upsetting never mentioned 
 element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary 
 films third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot 
 funny reality star wars world seems embedded mythology new agelike philosophy religion yet solution major conflicts series violence 
 technique hasnt used movies reallife situations countless times throughout history 
 least spirit ultimate powers good versus evil fun exciting matter 
 border cartoonish sometimes thats just film appealing inner child basic reason entire saga exists become big part modern society 
 phantom menace delivers exactly youd expect star wars film succeeds well always never truly achieves greatness 
 many things film weve seen done heart filmmakers concentrated just bit story character limited 
 film far bad least embraces spirit sheer fun movies
