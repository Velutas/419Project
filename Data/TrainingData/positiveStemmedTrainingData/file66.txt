 great film 
 stunning touching heartwrenching heartwarming lifeaffirming miraculous film 
 opening moments life beautiful walks fine line serious tragedy uplifting comedy 
 car brakes speeds town guido roberto benigni motions people move way 
 mistake fascist president traveling town day 
heil 
heil 
huh 
shortly thereafter president drives people stare blank faces 
 standard somehow fresh postmodern stuff clown also jew triumphs antisemitic society lives 
granted great dictator comes mindcharlie chaplins almost masterpiece 
 think lib benigni wrote directed trumps gd one essential point chaplins jewish barber gives great speech climax break completely character 
benigni given similar situation mistaken fascist dignitary must explain classroom filled schoolchildren scientists concluded aryans superior race 
benignis guido stays character delivers speech keeping subject matter intact showing absurdity concept 
 one great satirical scenes modern cinema 
 many scenes especially first half bright loopy funny silly 
slapstick reigns although film subtitled doubt universal language conveyed 
 although focus courtship guido dora played nicoletta braschi benignis real life wife silent undercurrent creeps 
 clearly racist society evidenced aforementioned scene others will soon affect family 
 second half film takes place five years later unnamed concentration camp guido dora insistence fiveyear old son giosue giorgio cantarini deported 
guido seeing horrors desperate protect wife child 
 wife separated must find ways communicate right 
 son controversial part film convinces youngster one big elaborate game rules include hiding quiet learning ask seconds 
 raises big questions deal pain 
 persecution 
 injustice worst level 
 said tragedies bring best people finding strengths realize 
 times deteriorate become overwhelmed little strength incentive swim 
sometimes even people giggle moments vacant emotion behind yearning brightness soothe wounds 
benignis guido realizes 
 clown fool 
 sees slurs vandalism feeling weight verbal attacks still audacity see everyone around perhaps even antagonists laugh 
 liberty stripped dignity certainly dignities around 
 obvious onset someone much fascism preposterousness aryan nation grinning joyful demeanor 
perhaps form denial 
perhaps alternate reality muster unlike different brazil 
 
perhaps example great fortitude weapons wit 
whatever purposes subject debate also sure sign one great threedimensional characters stranded amidst terrifyingly risky concept 
surprisingly works 
 important footnote film intended accurate reflection holocaust 
 atrocities trivialized far 
 dont broadcast explicitly shown muster horrorless 
 believe benigni cautious preserve tone like theory guidos alternate reality seeing 
however criticism rewriting history holocaust wasnt bad seems simply offtarget 
benignis film won audience awards cannes toronto definite shooin best foreign language film hopefully best picture well 
 made honorary jew jerusalem film society 
 swept italian academy awards 
controversy notwithstanding one great films year writing one beat best film 
masterful 
miraculous 
 mustsee
