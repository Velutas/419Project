mars attacks 
 c jack nicholson glenn close annette bening martin short danny devito rod steiger pierce brosnan sarah jessica parker michael j fox jim brown pam grier joe don baker natalie portman christina applegate lisa marie tom jones 
 director tim burtons finest film date 
many will compare tale martians invade earth independence day even though stories similar really two distinctly different films 
however whole mars attacks much entertaining id loved id 
 really right frame mind enjoy film 
 completely wackedout unlike anything youve ever seen 
 silly tone film set easy just sit back throw logic window logic comedy just dont mix 
 plot simple martians invade earth 
 different invasion film 
usually evil aliens versus heroic humans 
 time however goofy aliens versus equally goofy humans 
 martians computer generated just funniest things ive seen long time 
 look funny move funny language hilarious 
 special effects 
 effects mars attacks 
 just flawless ones ive seen date 
 computer animation martians combined goofy personalities given makes seem real 
 just couple scenes dont work mainly involving sarah jessica parker pierce brosnan board alien ship 
also glenn close overacts tremendously thankfully limited screen time much actually applauded silently character meets demise 
 many big laughs film said right mood 
 funnier 
certainly 
 funny enough 
yes 
 entertained 
absolutely 
 personal note id like thank whomever cast rod steiger favorite actor film warcrazy general decker 
finally many small parts direct video garbage minor tv roles steiger back big screen real movie many people will see 
 hes given type role can give real performance job well good lines dialogue 
 preview audience saw film really seemed enjoy
