 world coming end 
 dont know apparently way stop 
 world information months rioting assorted chaos passed governments shut operations 
yet handful toronto citizens life goes 
 arent going crazy attacking people streets 
instead simply preparing end 
 engaging activities theyve always wanted gathering family friends others just seeking alone 
 peoples lives however intersect final six hours 
writerdirectorstar don mckellar crafted highly unique emotional film 
 main characters compelling try whatever need last night earth 
craig callum keith rennie tries fulfill sexual fantasies gas company employee david cronenberg calls every customer letting know gas will flowing end thanks business patrick mckellar just wants isnt much success 
even minor characters keep popping least expect tying everyone even closer 
things seemed little hokey towards beginning film ultimately everything comes together nicely although happy film 
 moments understandably gutwrenching 
 story enhanced unexpected humor realistic performances particularly sandra oh whose character just trying get home husband end 
 absolutely problem reason end world never given bother world ending exactly midnight toronto anyway
