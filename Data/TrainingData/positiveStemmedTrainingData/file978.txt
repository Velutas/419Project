richard gere one favorite actors 
however like courtroom dramas film looked good enough take chance 
 wasnt disappointed 
 wasnt great film interesting took several unexpected turns 
one thing whats title 
 extremely forgettable doesnt really much film far determine 
 long run will probably hurt film people wont able think remember 
martin vail richard gere grandiose defense attorney 
 loves money fame go along defending successfully rich scum mafia men drugdealers 
 sees accused killer prominent chicago archbishop babyfaced alter boy wants case presumably press hell get 
 soon find prosecutor assigned former lover janet venable laura linney 
vail former prosecutor quit tensions district attorney played well john mahoney frasiers father tv series 
 underlying theme dichotomy movie people public faces private faces 
 see murdered archbishop accused strongly defense attorney martin vail 
richard gere fairly good job 
 first appears money attentiongrabbing lawyer consideration truth 
 see another side becomes seeker justice comes believe client 
alfre woodard judge capable though somewhat wasted standard role 
laura linney also journeyman work nothing spectacular acceptable 
 relationship vail believable verbal fencing adds film 
 actor playes vails investigator unfortunately dont remember name quite good 
 female assistant looked familiar cant remember ive seen also capable unspectacular 
 best performance film edward norton 
 excellent timid altarboy turned alleged butcher boy st mikes 
 impressed depth plot redherrings deadends lesser film lead predictable ending 
 liked plot twists film took supporting characters thus give primal fear respectable b rating
