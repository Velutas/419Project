stone constructed film mythical good vs evil tale relayed fastpaced milieu burgeoning stock exchange 
critics audiences lauded wall street elevating status contemporary classic 
im proud say will never counted one 
 found wall street just axiomatic pandering majority stones output thin caricatures obvious sentiments charisma barren performance young charlie sheen 
stone goes broke every scene said nearly works 
 approach tends bury purported message beneath heap good intentions 
 directs stock exchange scenes typical hyperbolic mode people shouting phones plummeting airplane 
 excuse stone ratchet emotion false intensity rather explore situations really like 
 feeling brokers psychologically manipulative presented boiler room rather laughably top 
 guys salesmen televised judges 
 anything baffled many adore wall street 
 possible solution can muster release date 
 just timeliness greed good subject matter film plumped eighties decade onejoke comedy rose art form group glamorous brat packers smirked way inane high concept low result movies 
 mind eighties will forever remembered decade proliferation bad movies bad music bad hair bad clothes 
maybe stones school special set wall street viewed welcome change pace 
boiler room equally welltimed film similarities stones piece crap 
 feature consequential fatherson relationship though boiler rooms much subtle touching 
 concerned power greed yet men boiler room akin poseurs presuming big shots rather slipperysmooth heartless gordon gecko figures wall street 
boiler room message movie well though least end doesnt shove faces 
boiler room pursuit cash degrees people will go cash 
 said film indeed timely society wants millionaire number one prime time show every day bringing revolution prime time tv watching hasnt seen quite want millionaires want watch people become millionaires 
 superjudgmental poweroriented culture desire money supersedes everything money 
 seth giovanni ribisi wants easy way 
hes wellintentioned college drop gets lured working illegally run brokerage firm kind sells junk stock whereupon meets others just like 
ben affleck cast jim company headhunter struts commanding room like frat boy gordon gecko 
 job influence trainees becoming enthusiastic employees giving speech subtly attacks man hood 
 ironic sells pups load b s theyre told dish prospective buyers 
afflecks character obviously supposed recall alec baldwins similar character glengary glen ross proves detrimental actors performance 
affleck shouts curses belittles rookie employees just like baldwin minus edge 
 alec played scene became part spewing brutal lines 
 comparison affleck simply looks really hammy line reading 
 brokers approach job fervor overzealous jocks storm work like football players way big game 
rap music thumps soundtrack effectively illustrating guys think intellectual gangsters 
 arent rumble test man hood especially leisure time lumbering scott caan seems eager use fists minor disputes 
 drink world along seth watch become seduced just like might 
 cautionary tales boiler room begins seducing us illustrious world profit wrongdoing smacks us consequences recklessness 
 know story 
 
 can work told intelligence energy writer director ben younger tells 
 director please excuse french miseenscene younger much learn 
 style sitcom bland 
 writing isnt 
youngers script well studied vernacular bunch dialogue like junior david mamet 
despite moderate camera work younger fills phonepitch scenes tension comes just performances tightly wound script 
 brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying buying stock 
 moments filmed like psychological action scenes tense confrontation victimizer victim isnt aware one 
 exception afflecks brief appearances performances truly exceptional 
ribisi edgy looks character actor extremely potent working pale angular face eerie plaintive stare worth 
 conveys childlike vulnerability character seems hide corner whenever things arent going way scenes others hes ferociously cut throat 
 jekyll hyde contradiction works well movie ribisi confident just phone cowardly front authority figures including abrasive father authoritatively played ron rifkin 
boiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics salespitch sequences sales build slowly like crescendo intelligent psychological ploys 
 ploys taught seth chris vin diesel kind broker alternates seths friend mentor 
diesl shines minor role 
 week saw scifi opus pitch black diesel plays completely different role equally effective manner 
 film kind role might gone arnold schwarzenegger s boiler room kind role might gone elliot gould s 
nicky katt also memorable superior broker obsessed cant 
nia long firms secretary lone black women amongst many white men ribisis love interest part first looks insignificant parts talented actress gets develops something interesting 
 two make oddly likeable couple 
long smart brash ribisi charmingly aloof 
 one point says im just lookin chocolate love 
 terrible line ribisi delivers innocuous childlike way becomes sweetly endearing 
unfortunately towards end boiler room turns tad schmaltzy 
 much crying hugging sorrowful stares 
 okay taken small doses youngers conclusion constructed series boohoo moments one following 
 particular misstep attempt show effect seths manipulations one poor victims 
 bad idea execution lacking scenes feeling tacked spell message 
 message greed bad 
yes patently obvious boiler room conveys introducing us culture havent seen much movies disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur 
 wall street introduce us simplistic fantasy world saints sinners 
boiler room offers neither extreme 
 gives us thankful
