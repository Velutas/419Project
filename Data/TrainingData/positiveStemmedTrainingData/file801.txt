 frequently read reviews likely surprised fact read victor hugos novel les miserables 
 dont know lot people though imagine many familiar popular musical based novel 
 havent even seen 
going film almost knowledge story characters even expected film musical 
walking away im kind glad prior experience material 
writerdirector bille augusts film version straightforward beautifully told film 
liam neeson stars miserable jean valjean beginning just released year prison sentence 
 allowed stay convent kindly priest despite rude destructive behavior 
 priests words wisdom influence makes vow change 
nine years later informed now mayor town called vigo nobody knows real name wanted skipping parole nine years ago 
conflicts arise inspector javert geoffrey rush assigned vigo 
valjean remembers javert one prison guards constantly beat javert remembers jean convict 
javert hellbent upholding law everything power bring jean justice 
along way valjean meets falls love peasant woman fantine uma thurman vows take care daughter cosette played later claire danes 
les miserables visually solid often striking picture 
 production design anna asp authentic vast sets dont look like sets look like real towns villages gabriella pescuccis costumes noticeably spectacular 
basil poledouris soundtrack thick usually wellplaced though get bit heavy times 
many scenes film memorable photographic quality climax takes place next dark river grey obscurity early evening 
augusts keeps story simple hear good thing since novel complex easy follow 
 manages develop main characters subplots adequately 
 also impressed didnt go overboard flash style something many directors seem classic stories days baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo juliet 
 film feels solid whole scene certain amount importance vigor keeps audience interested 
liam neeson terrific main role neeson kind actor solemn desperation extremely well valjean certainly man clearly fits adjective 
thurman small role good proves lot range can perform nonglamorous role one 
rush absolutely incredible javert dont remember ever feeling strongly villain adds depth complexity subtle glances nuances effortlessly makes scenes intense 
 cant charitable danes however though know talented actress tends overact might better underplay character bit 
les miserables ive said solid intelligent motion picture 
 complaint feels bit easy perhaps staged 
 scene grand huge exploding poledouris score didnt always want 
 part les miserables subtle deep picture 
 good movie tells story well august tends handfeed us themes scenes worked better subtle 
however film exciting wellproduced minor flaws easily overlooked
