rating good shot stars 
languid yet pointed focused ghost dog way samurai sublimely savages cultural fascination mafia sleek ultracool cinematic image hitman 
juxtaposing samurais honor code feudal japan tradition bound modus operandi americanitalian mafia ceaselessly chips away sculptors precision archaic foundations lumber dinosaurlike function modern era 
director jarmusch gleefully plays iconoclast ripping mafioso precepts splashes acidic wit 
using palate bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains tone desolation belies many sparks laugh loud humor punctuating film 
 doesnt cater audience expectations hypercolorized stylized violence gunplay one dies 
 action presented flat brutal codas 
bullets permanence 
death consequences 
 movie rises beyond standard conventions become meditation concepts honor loyalty 
 antimovie sorts 
 photogenic empathetic characters audience fall love 
 isnt film lovingly holds hand 
 dark contemplative moments film firmly holds shoulder just asserting see 
 fulcrum movies thematic balancing act ghost dog mafia hitman 
 twist stereotypical image mob enforcer ghost dog hilarious contradiction terms 
unlike sleek muscular killing machines one accustomed given inner city black man overweight slovenly replete chapped dirty hands rumpled clothing 
 wears hooded sweatshirt often pulls head giving monklike appearance 
 acrobatic back flips shiny super guns arsenal 
 uses old worn weapons simply goes tasks economical efficient pleasureless fashion 
ghost dog disciple old ways samurai distilling essence life filter book reads daily hagakure way samurai 
life consists simple pleasures ice cream warm rooftop naps good books 
ghost dog lives basic tenet expressed book one start day considering oneself dead 
living atop abandoned building surrounded flock pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists netherworld lacking creature comforts friends 
 craves nothing 
 puts late film ive seen want see 
 exists spiritual world mind gaining moral sustenance readings 
ghost dog wasnt always presented 
 several roshomonlike flashbacks shown ghost dog assaulted racist white males beaten nearly death timely intervention good samaritan samaritan foot soldier aging crime family 
ghost dog pledges life service man louie tormey repayment 
 years loyal service ghost dog sent louie kill handsome frank made man within louies organization run away crime bosss daughter louise vessey 
ghost dog wordlessly executes task witnessed louise spares sits watching betty boop cartoon clutching copy book roshomon 
 bit synchronicity louise loans book ghost dog 
upset frank taken someone family mob bosses turn put hit ghost dog perverse twist loyalty assassinated comrade 
 rest movie holds dated value systems mafia ghost dog light new millennium many acerbic asides two come factions come conflict 
 theme old cartoons flares time time showing cartoon violence sharp counterpoint reality ghost dogs world 
 time character shown watching cartoon era betty boop felix cat etc reflection days gone 
near end louise watching cartoon thats departure previously shown ones 
 bit audacity jarmuschs part nicely effective despite surrealistic nature 
 ghost dog floats world life touched two people 
one sage little girl winbush connects ghost dog love reading 
 comes symbolize melding old ways new sensibilities just louise ultimately 
 films end fact jamusch effective illustrating tenuous bond two testament skill writer 
 person ghost dogs world ice cream de bankole vendor speaks french yet intuitively shares rapport ghost dog 
 vendor literal stranger strange land 
jarmusch rappercomposer rza underscores film rap reggae music first blush seems dichotomous primal rhythms serve strengthen fundamental nature movie 
ghost dog seems draw type strength rap music listens negotiates streets various stolen cars 
 presents another paradox ghosts dogs sense honor 
 head mafioso played henry silva stone faced resignation 
 cartoonish mobsters one appears self aware state world 
gorman plays sonny lieutenant respects old ways yet quirky affinity rap music love comically shown several impromptu displays 
ruffini seems truest reflection mafia 
 husk man assisted two hearing aids barks advice without truly hearing others saying 
whitaker carries film using truly great actors use face 
ghost dog reticent speak often going long periods without 
 fact whitaker can convey wide range emotion gesture look remarkable talent 
although film deliberate pace late night drives walks taken ghost dog dragged momentum 
truly tragic ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor final confrontation mob 
 reveals desperate spiritual guidance hagakure fails truly adapt real true world 
carried shoulders remarkable performance whitaker ghost dog rises beyond characterization icon figure garners sympathy bit pity
