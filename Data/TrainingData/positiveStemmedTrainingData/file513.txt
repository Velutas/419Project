 may seem weird begin film glam rock sequence includes spaceship green ovular pin birth oscar wilde one really strains can see perhaps maybe connections half 
wildes philosophy everyone true human nature result following philosophy imprisoned loosing family career 
 glam rock movement early s england similar take came similar demise 
 main difference placing makeup face acting deepest fantasies inquiries life mostly dealing androgony sexuality became less less like like everyone else 
 thats movement seemed end soon began 
 said todd haynes velvet goldmine film chronicles like part movement experienced created steals lot citizen kane thats true 
 film british journalist s arthur stuart christian bale asked go back find happened s glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star faked death stage bringing end career entire glam rock movement 
structurewise totally steals kane setup interviews three people story result flashbacks things like beginning death newsreel smaller details like bitter exfriend wheelchair bitter exwife washedup lounge singer found bar hours 
 kane really doesnt aspire doesnt attempt deep outlook something gone like kane doesnt really uncover anything poignant humanity 
instead uses flashbacks form contrast magic glam rock era boredom life glam rock participants 
 s scenes dry deliriously melancholy equipped performance bale perhaps appropriately dull unengaging 
 s scenes engaging though mention addictively campy 
 radiate gorgeous cinematography nicely accentuates vibrant colors era feel thats eerily lighthearted combined thenfootage become symbol decadence times everything seemed simple 
instead creating world way haynes paints world narcotic fairy tale glam rock movement full much freedom liberation youve experienced everything else seems mundane 
theres outside world speak secluding people inside protective globe will eventually crack 
haynes focuses story tale blade fictitious rock hero curt wild relationship created molded brought movement reducing everyone else contributed merely contributors 
blade played reserve pouty jonathan rhys meyers wild played anarchic wildness ewan mcgregor little thinly disguised recreations david bowie iggy pop respectively complete creation ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon confirmation two rock stars may well onetime partners music also partners bed 
 discussions slades exmanager cecil michael feast exwife mandy toni collette reinventing american blonde dish fakes british accent slade finally expartner wild journalist stuart begins remember experiences era like discovery rebelliousness cum conformity including moment began questioning sexuality opens first slade record finds naked green slade lying crimson blanket finally running away home part london scene finally resulting leading boring job america 
haynes demonstrates hes quite visual auteur molding scenes like long heald breaths seemingly long sequence juxtaposing sladewild concert performing brian eno cover babys fire scenes decadent drug party films wowinspiring sequence first concert scene wild band ratttz mcgregor lets loose much anarchic steam wild iggyesuqe movements including stripping naked screams film captures perfect moment one discovers major talent another slade discovers idle 
even brief music videos spoofs bowies rare visual flair thats pure camp cause ken russell drool 
 best sequence though may beginning following prelude sequence acts middle ground actual movement postmovement era 
 stuart mates going infamous slade concert fakes death kills alter ego maxwell demon appears real assasination brought end era one swift fake bullet 
 brian enos famous needle camels eye playing background scene detached exhileration song doesnt seem played quite way songs 
 distance thats hard put finger seems represent coming quick sad ending one sees slade dressing room show docked silver frock wings blue hair depressingly staring mirror comes nonetooobvious prophecy finale beginning film 
 movies much plot way presented making one films classified style substance statement prompts many critics line attack 
however part engaging part film story rather way haynes creates world using sets costumes cinematography especially music play characters film 
 music especially notable 
 soundtrack wall wall consists old school glam rock tunes likes brian eno trex roxy music well covers slades band vocals thom yorke occasionally rhys meyers even newer music shudder think sounds uncannily bowielike 
 cast rather impressive one really walks away film performances extremely good 
although eddie izzard slades manager challenges slades first manager armwrestling match see gets control career michael feast first tragic manager come greatly collette mcgregor moments rhys meyers bale noticably subpar neither putting lot effort respective roles 
 fault actual construction film haynes 
rhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor glam rock era dying turned retrogarbo resorting life salingerism found mids lying around sniffing coke ass party girl 
 fact one film really seen person rather just symbol composite type thrived era 
bales character especially tough sell bitter depressed flashbacks young adulthood hes extremely personal character cliched experiences hounded record store guys buying record put poof never help us communicate 
nevertheless rhys meyers mcgregor excuses characters really characters rather results era left others bitter part helps film work since major piece eye candy 
 prime movie least look role fashionable leaders slade perpetuallychanging androgonys persona wild topless unpredictable image clash fuse unstable union 
 story slade influenced wild adapted similar whocares attitude crossed camp engaging without personal background 
 story stuart though tougher sell hes everyman cant totally identify everyman storys slight trouble 
 cultural rock piece velvet goldmine rather good merely good 
 never totally takes although moments absolutely flies comes back 
 really nothing bunch really great moments surrounded material really much better 
 beginning captivating slow middle fantastic ending shallow worse drags final half hour bring story real conclusion probably stop point 
 anyone really figure mystery arthur unearths 
 almost seems like point entire investigation unearth past commendable totally 
still oliver stone pic doors didnt right becoming insightful happened using visual style hit right notes contrast made era great lived living era everything else seems halfassed suppose message live life youve lived else point youll forced live regretful memories 
 really superb achievement film flashbacks successfully creates audience must felt like era added perk knowing result goes
