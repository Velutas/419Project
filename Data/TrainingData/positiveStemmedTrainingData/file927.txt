director sam raimi evil dead darkman fame made excellent thoughtprovoking film worlds away comic horror films made name 
 couple moments might remind one earlier work raimi made intelligent mature departure will hopefully sign even greater films come 
scott b smiths screenplay based novel havent read fine example escalating tension 
 remind one danny boyles shallow grave without abundance black humour keeps drama really part story morality lack thereof found film subject matter 
alar kivilos cinematography reminds one joel ethan coens fargo bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character 
danny elfman also well moody finelywritten score 
 theres flaw film goes just little long 
just think wrap things raimi smith decide let film go little 
 isnt really bad thing become little frustrating times may due fact consumed large sprite beforehand 
 performances excellent usually annoying paxton fine form bridget fonda giving scenestealing turn hanks scheming wife 
 excellent showcase thorntons fine skills actor great change direction raimi well career ahead accomplished director dramatic films 
fingers crossed though doesnt stop making another evil dead sequel
