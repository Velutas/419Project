director dominic sena made highly underrated kalifornia producer jerry bruckheimer rock armageddon bring us slick entertaining remake film name absolutely one ever seen 
nicolas cage plays memphis retired car thief whos pulled back business evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi 
memphis ordered steal cars four days time brother will meet unfortunate demise elude detectives hot trail rival car thief feels job given gang 
memphis sets put old crew back together discovers retired well 
gone sixty seconds things right opening credits 
 sequence get rockin little tune moby along simple back story told photographs assorted objects 
filmmakers can sometimes make break film just opening title sequence one easily gets mindset entertaining ride 
 follows doesnt disappoint 
cage turns one good performances can easily go either way 
good bad 
 dont know mannerisms dialogue delivery carry film along nicely 
 supporting cast members angelina jolie memphis former love film just provide eye candy shes definitely hottest looking grease monkey ive ever seen robert duvall memphis former mentor just around lend film class 
also im big fan will patton armageddon postman love see get huge role someday 
none three performers given much unfortunately 
 underrated performers however given meaty supporting roles 
delroy lindo get shorty shines exasperated detective pursuit memphis timothy olyphant go lindos partner 
 just wish characters important 
 real gripe film though conclusion 
mainly know will end opening credits even roll 
theres doubt anyones mind cars will successfully stolen filmmakers blew perfectly good opportunity add suspense picture using rival car thief plot line 
 stands story line wrapped halfway film tidy little package 
 making film id rival gang trying get cars memphis crew thereby making memphis improvise 
thereby adding meat plot 
 finale essentially just big car chase just arent ways make car chases interesting anymore 
 done 
 chase also shot edited jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind way leaves audience wondering specifically going scene 
sure car chase exactly particulars 
 hard tell 
finally theres stunt scene comes close challenging bus jumping ramp sequence speed oh dont think 
department 
despite minor complaints gone sixty seconds pure summer movie entertainment 
 thought provoking shiny loud fun 
just summer flick
