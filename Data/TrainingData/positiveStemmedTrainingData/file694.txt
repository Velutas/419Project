let first say conditions forced watch matrix less ideal 
 tried fair possible considering viewing experience significantly less ideal 
 watched matrix theater serious need upgrades best times 
 circumstances ever allowed show big budget special effects laden film like matrix 
 theater owned parent company one hollywoods biggest studios hasnt even graduated stereo sound yet 
 mono sound audience subjected sounded coming speaker many years past mandatory retirement age 
 words sound sucked 
 someone used digital sound movie theater bad sound doesnt anything add film 
im even going go horrible splicing job projectionist putting film together 
 ive rant now regularly scheduled review 
 sadly wont include commentary films sound im assuming spectacular im just guessing 
 guess sound seems like fairly solid one considering visual quality matrix 
 nothing short stunning visually 
sadly rest film pretty good doesnt quite measure obvious effort expended making film look darn good 
 matrix core good concept although strays confusing side often liked 
keanu reeves plays computer hacker drawn frightening realization reality just hoax 
 turns many years ago world devastated sort disaster 
now machines run planet humans spend lives sort incubator plugged computer network 
 computers generating virtual reality world representation earth destroyed 
 population planet never realizes entire life hoax really spend entire lives comatose 
 except small band discovered horrible secret escaped virtual prisons 
 now spend lives combating computers effort expose lie 
reeves character neo recruited band rebels led morpheus laurence fishburne 
newcomer carrieanne moss one hollywoods underrated actors joe pantoliano join fishburne band freedomfighters 
 action sequences nothing short spectacular 
 can attributed much amazing special effects many actors extensive preproduction training martial arts 
 lends best martial arts sequences ever likely see film 
 add wild effects computer generated world adds eyeful 
 already said visuals far outpace rest film 
acting matrix bad certainly isnt real good either 
keanu reeves gives usual fairly emotionless performances 
although credit one better performances 
laurence fishburne hand often seemed forget scifi action film 
 times delivered lines thought performing sort shakespearean drama 
joe pantoliano little used film made 
carrieanne moss turned surprisingly good performance first feature film role 
 nice see cast much talent breathtaking looks 
 give main actors healthy dose credit work obviously put physical training roles film 
 clear small effort went getting moves perfectly fighting sequences 
 also put much blame somewhat strained performances matrix dialogue terrible times 
 places got way existential liking times just plain weird 
 almost seems though writers difficult time trying figure explain concept movie 
 decided make dialogue obtuse possible one figure heck talking 
thereby covering leaps faith may make departments logic believability 
 major complaint matrix unsatisfying ending 
 setup hokey frankly used many bad film 
 ending just plain strange 
 main reasons recommend matrix visual effects computer animation make real treat watch 
 rest film acting dialogue degree plot detract high production values dont detract enough prevent recommending matrix fun way spend evening
