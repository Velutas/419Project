 couple months ago first downloaded faceoff trailer net initial reaction fourteen carrot gold yawn 
followed swiftly press computers delete key wanting waste six seven megabytes precious space pisspoor trailer 
 started reading first wave reviews u s unique excellent mustsee 
well thought still skeptical suppose might well go see gets 
 course still three months away 
ill admit trotted see film john woo movie seen fairly enjoyable highly forgetable broken arrow 
id heard good things previous work movies like hard boiled films definitely mustsee list 
 let tell changed completely 
 knew fact five minutes film brilliantly shot acted opening sequence sean archer loses son blew feet 
 acting throughout film staggeringly good action flick 
seriously 
ive never big john travolta fan like cage perfectly suited role movie sorry 
make roles movie 
even travoltas great performance however paled comparison cages character portrayals 
 favourite cage scene definitely crashed compardre dietrich hasslers hideout 
half drugged mind sits reclining back chair talking sons death castors perspective doesnt just break heart mutters coldly 
now dont go thinking previous comments brilliant acting drama focused movie 
thats really makes movie unique 
 action movie brilliantly portrayed characters common mix 
suspension disbelief paramount movie though thats 
 way overlook fact travolta cage fire around rounds 
never hit 
several action scenes just well choreographed just make wish press rewind watch 
 part archer troy stand either side doublesided mirror just plain brilliant 
whilst cages travoltas performances enough alone sustain movies lesser characters just intriguing 
joan allen usually sticks straight drama movies plays part perfectly archers long suffering wife 
 like fact character didnt end toting gun end movie 
 wrecked potrayal 
gina gershon surprising say least castor troys mistreated girlfriend make one castor troys mistreated girlfriends 
 movies used character just window dressing 
sex object instead character strong independent 
dominique swain plays archers daughter also nice job though character explored much allens gershons 
faults well say 
first movies ending whilst good overall bit drawn good 
 two combatants begin duelling final boat crash cant help think geez guys nuclear powered 
 certain bits werent handled properly like archer appears safe sound solid ground jumping converted oil platformprison explanation nice 
overall movie perfect 
 thought close action movie ever came perfect 
many critics claimed movie will change way action movies made 
certainly hope
