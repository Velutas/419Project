 theme sidney lumets failsafe fictional drama based novel eugene burdick harvey wheeler 
 failsafe takes place heart cold war actual film released two years cuban missile crisis united states soviet union static discord issue can summarized single word communism 
 premise centers around combination accidents operation flaws 
five u s bombers carrying nuclear warheads ordered set routine course moscow unidentified aircraft spotted heading toward america 
 unidentified aircraft turns commercial airliner mechanical failure strikes military base commands bombers 
suddenly contact standing orders remain course receiving new directives bomber pilots recalled proceed moscow intention destroying nuclear strike 
 great deal failsafe s plot follows various characters attempt devise ways stopping u s bombers reaching russias bordersat cost

 reality sets quickly one attempt turn bombers another fails 
general bogan frank overton taking orders directly president united states henry fonda powerlessthe fate world lies hands automated preprogrammed system may stoppable simply creators war machines efficient task make nowin situation winnable 
 events failsafe fascinating theyre anything predictable real reason failsafe works understands nuclear war exists within confines plot 
 key ingredient film ability create ongoing polemic nuclear war communism cold war united states role 
 films use character groeteschele walter matthau arrogant civilian theorist nuclear weapons use incidentally presidents advising staff analyzing statistical plausibility waging nuclear war 
many films pointed messages arise discussions groeteschele one key voices 
early film hosts dinner party explains importance strategy nuclear assault minimize casualties 
 whats difference million million dead 
 guest asks impatiently 
 forty million groeteschele responds wryly 
 problem groetescheles mindset believes nuclear combat viable method war 
 difference nuclear armageddon conventional warfare raw data casualty totals 
groeteschele realizes weapons can destroy world several times 
yet answer arms race slow try cool situation general black dan oherlihy often recommended 
 contraryaccording groeteschele lead russia nuclear weapons u s clearly put america disadvantage 
 stance perhaps central paradox misguided practice arms race 
 failsafe clearly sees one central issues cold war likewise becomes central theme film 
 continue build machines mass destruction already possessing enough destroy world several times 
 wise 
 even logical 
 really 
although failsafe issue nuclear weapons political ramifications communism scene film deals communism intentionally superficial onesided sort way 
 achieved groeteschele easily films important character terms largertheme significance 
 addition providing central pronuclear war voice film warns also makes key remarks communists show just much fear resentment people period prone came communism 
 context film uses suggests hatred often glib 
one groetescheles logical trains thought ventures far fantasy theoretical prediction merely absurd 
 labels average marxist unfeeling calculating machine will whatever takes preserve 
groeteschele takes far say u s drops warhead moscow soviets will instantly surrender retaliate invite countermeasures destroy russias home soilwhich must preserved costs 
groeteschele seems forget people human beings emotions general black quickly reminds soviets attack revengeas normal person 
 irony groetescheles mechanical theorizing 
 quick judge enemy doesnt even realize seemingly programmed thought patterns 
 film makes evident turning u s bombers will impossible question becomes consequences destroying moscow will 
just will soviet unions leader react can president convey best intentions 
 just one pass deaths millions people mishap 
 help translator buck larry hagman president negotiates length soviet leader scenes prove amazingly taut powerful simplicity lumets long takes fonda hagman frame exchanging dialog president soviet leader 
without getting much detail will say compromise ultimately reach costly yet necessary sensible possible circumstances 
 sensible nuclear incident can probably 
 accomplish must avoids allout war something simply isnt possible alltooreal consequences 
dramatically ending quite powerful use oherlihys character symbolic matador providing bookend film ending story tying dream sequence films opening particularly appropriate 
 failsafe production major hollywood studio released columbia pictures structure hightension suspense thriller one might expect hollywood film 
nevertheless lumets direction walter bernsteins intelligent adaptation burdicks wheelers novel film continues lasting effect even events screen unfolded 
 film often warns automation war something may make nuclear holocaust unintentional consequence mass arming 
 conscious human choice initialize automatic arming failsafe also finds dangerous 
 retrospect arms race seems one puzzling exercises futility century 
 just fortunate sides finally able come senses slow rather continuing groetescheles dangerous approach speeding causing possible meltdown
