cinema around hundred years now 
 job recap century every time talk new film id like think im beginning understand art watch films time 
recently ive seen films hitchcock capra fellini godard kurosawa chaplin lang many others 
 men talented artists films reflect genius 
 likely remembered 
 
 
well quite 
 like film 
yes disasterslashaction movie 
true budget lot money ill ever see lifetime 
 theres doubt mind reason conceived make lot money 
 fact bet producers armageddon worked towards lousy film thought wouldve profitable 
 certainly dont care intentions michael bay rock skilled director doubt hed ever make film difficult sit 
 course skillful direction doesnt complete package rest armageddon manages keep everything together 
 story wellthought perfectly paced provide abundance action sequences never feel place acting terrific script sharp get characters 
yes read right 
armageddon actually characters can care 
 dont like film problem genre armageddon good film like can 
 youve seen deep impact know basic framework story 
 turns asteroid size texas going strike earth eighteen days start film 
 u s government stop 
 u s always exclusively saddled problems never fully investigated 
 plan send group experienced oil drillers asteroid drill several hundred feet detonate nuclear warhead within 
 head driller harry stamper bruce willis 
 group men colorful bunch including j 
 ben affleck chick will patton rockhound steve buscemi 
theres also interesting triangle formed j harry grace liv tyler harrys daughter 
 j 
 grace course romantically intertwined dad isnt happy situation 
 absurd wish complicated story event movie special effects movie whatever youd like call armageddon 
 story viscera action thrillsaminute stuff 
 incidental really story cohesive even remotely believable people will wrapped explosions give two seconds thought actually happens 
 bay one congratulate case made film entertaining visually sharp doubt director done better 
 think budget went cameras alone bay films every action sequence thirty forty different angles 
take spectacular opening scene instance meteor shower obliterates new york 
 meteor flies sky crashes building sends fireballs erupting air cars spinning like tops upon cars 
 action might take five seconds real life bay edits quickly get scene six different ways 
 like quickedit style abrasive exhausting watch 
 also loud obnoxiously noisy times 
 fun obnoxious sometimes 
 special effects film put every blockbuster shame 
deep impact visually absolutely nothing armageddon offer comparison quality film godzilla simply laughable 
special effects important film like theyre good image convincing film doesnt work 
everything looks bright explosive little meteors bursting skyscrapers way shots earth jutting rocks ominously approaching asteroid 
 effects dont look totally real still pleasure behold credit everyone involved creating first blockbuster nicelooking actually qualifies art 
 course add little aboveaverage light show didnt get feeling bay cares much characters action 
 film two half hours long spent submerged numbing action 
much film dedicated developing various characters subplots 
 wont suggest complex characters problems real emotions arent put forth sentimental overbearing way 
 fact three four scenes pretty choked thats lot can say deep impact banking feelgood parts story 
bruce willis terrific im glad see bigger life recent turns films like mercury rising disappointing 
tyler affleck great together make convincing couple scenes work comfortable level 
patton magnificent actor thankfully wasted minor subplot revolving around exwife son moving 
 comic relief buscemi peter stormare plays crazy russian astronaut nifty keeps film lively funny 
 wasnt challenged think real hard watching armageddon dont mind much 
 film doesnt insult intelligence pitched perfectly entertain really wants 
 mindless escapist wellcrafted cinema 
 might created wrong reasons men like michael bay respect showing interested making something good spite producers budget 
im saying films like risky moves 
 saying armageddon big loud expensive motion picture reminds art often comes strangest forms
