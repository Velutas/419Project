 first glance daylight seem like typical disaster movie 
 second glance looks way 
although typical disaster movies go daylight isnt bad 
admittedly seems rip great deal plot devices disaster flicks days gone think poseidon adventure 
 decent dialogue surprisingly good acting make havent seen scene somewhere 
feeling creeps often film 
sylvester stallone stars recently fired head new yorks emergency response team 
 sheer luck right place right time disaster strikes unaware inhabitants little film 
 disaster 
 ask inch ever closer edge seat 
glad asked 
 whole sequence entirely probable events probable hitting lottery large explosion takes place lincoln tunnel running hudson river new york city 
 explosion results tunnel collapsing ends causes massive loss life traps dozen people inside wreckage tunnel 
good old sly feet away entering tunnel collapses offers services rescuers gladly accept 
sly enters tunnel vent shaft think judge dredd can go proceeds try rescue trapped inside 
 begins fun fun quick tunnel started spring leak 
 acting expect stallone movie 
 superb means far films think judge dredd 
daylights acting probably average little terms sort genre starring particular star 
amy brenneman actor note pretty good job stallones reluctant helper 
oh yeah stallones real life son sage 
sage nice name 
 guess worse named nutmeg parsley 
note sage still young 
go school get good education dont future acting 
 plot runs along lines acting interesting predictable 
mostly due fact pretty well recycled dozen action flicks 
 biggest problem film nature try cram many things movie 
 soon cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle another one seems pop right even worse last one 
 realize wouldnt much movie otherwise make movie bit predictable 
adding predictability cast characters course include least one two difficult people want things way think qualified guy case stallone doesnt know 
 disaster movies can never everyone agree work together 
 much ask 
cant just get along 
special effects werent bad ive certainly seen better 
 scenes fun watch blatant ripoffs wonder scripts old movies just copied verbatim 
especially scenes involved anything underwater tunnel course starts flood 
 really expected gene hackman roddy mcdowell ernest borgnine appear minute wasnt sure watching daylight poseidon adventure 
 suppose rip movie good ideas poseidon adventure good one use 
 underwater sequences aside deja vu well shot worked fairly well 
 best part movie long shot 
better average stallone flick 
 realize thats saying much man judge dredd resume 
 certainly standards cliffhanger 
daylight fun movie long arent expecting whole lot might even pleasantly surprised
