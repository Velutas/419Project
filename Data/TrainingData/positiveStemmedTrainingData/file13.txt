yelchin good bobby finding good mix innocence resignation 
 splendid still boorem praised highly work along came spider simply radiant carol 
 hopkins despite playing quiet introspective character ted nonetheless commands attention every time onscreen 
less successful davis whose strident elizabeth comes across overly cartoonish
