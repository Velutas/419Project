 think competent member human race whos ever seen movieany moviecould probably predict just every turn wedding singer 
even though try hard predict films im watching especially romantic comedies plot particular film just advanced seconds sometimes minutes actually saw happen screen 
 dont care 
 even little 
 reasons simple adam sandler great 
 drew barrymore great 
 movie funny 
 parts left gasping air laughing hard 
 havent laughed hard movie since austin powers 
sandler plays robby hart wedding singer dreams rock band writing music 
 opening scenes seems like happygolucky wedding singer least partially enjoying profession rather good job talking really drunk individual steve buscemi decides brothers wedding good place tell whole world life point utter pointlessness 
 week later wedding left standing altar exfianc e linda angela featherstone 
 life complete disarray meets julia barrymore waitress 
 engaged glenn matthew glave marry three months 
julia robby become good friends enlists help wedding plans 
soon predictably becomes pretty clear glenn jerk robby julia really love 
oh sure trite 
 anyone making film expected us like feel suspense something watching wedding singer truly underestimated audience 
 makes story bearable aside terrific costumes s music performances 
barrymore simply adorable ive never seen look close way et 
 pleasant look acting job really good oneand doesnt hurt character likable adequately wellwritten 
 jerk played fullforce graves just despicable villain romantic comedy ive ever seen 
naturally true star sandler 
 think guy flatout hilarious 
 can say something just isnt funny delivery makes laugh 
 comedic performance equals happy gilmore film goes much proves can indeed hold leading man romantic comedy 
whereas roles previous films kind sandler playing sandler wedding singer gives character first time actually fit 
 far im concerned succeeded film testimony fact range talents 
 movie just funny 
perhaps best moment sings song julia claims little uneven began writing good mood finished fianc e abandoned 
 part literally groping breath air 
 film like romantic comedies takes hiatus laughs towards end plot finish enough truly hilarious moments first hour make slumps progress second half 
 formal complaints wedding singer arent important 
 film predicable cares 
 characters extremely likable movie ridiculously funny experience simply enjoyable 
 addition cant imagine anyone seeing preview wanting see film 
 order conclude pointless even written review 
 just want everyone know laughed 
 lot
