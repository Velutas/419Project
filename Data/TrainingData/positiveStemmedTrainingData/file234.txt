 broadens horizons really moves ant colony really shows us whole new world weve never seen take evolution bugs lot better one antz 
 also light clever 
 visuals instead earth tones bright worldly colors still gives amazing visual technology antz least worthy contender 
 characters also nicely realized though watereddown broad consumption still carry wit contemporary disney animated films
