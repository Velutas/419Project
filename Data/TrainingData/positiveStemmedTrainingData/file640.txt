 bond series island film world else look forward cliches things occur films 
 else pure escapism vulnerable hero talking villains blatant product placement predictable action sequences lots promiscuity hoped instead significant change 
 dont understand thats bond series based 
 think films weve mostly got thing variation bit change notably two dalton films 
 even king cynicism cant bitch 
 tomorrow never dies think eighteenth bond film second brosnan bond film exception 
thank god 
 plot pure balderdash seems nice kind edge 
instead just plain billionaire psychotics get rupert murdochesque media mogulpsychotic elliot carver jonathan pryce looking bitching whitehaired cru cut always talking like hes breath admittingly ingenius idea getting ratings creating war 
 wag dog wants real war china england stupid enough put coverage anyone else discovered 
comes bond 
james sent around world trying research carver fighting men running one occasion chinese secret agent like wai lin michelle yeoh asian action star extraordinaire 
costar supercop nearly stealing screen jackie chan one 
 two eventually predictably course begin working together yes sexual tension two 
luckily relationship never strained never gives cassanovaness finale 
thank god 
 every bond film james bags average three women sometimes sometimes less latter potent towards aidscautionary dalton doesnt spoil one though never see course mean need stay around pg rating 
theres always one beginning chick never see big bond girl yeoh time almostcameo teri hatcher carvers wife paris seems one girls bags beginning 
yes teris attractive seems kind dull 
 course really fault part underwritten shes small part 
oh well 
 always big henchmen guys dirty work polished big villains 
 time get tall arianlooking mention robert shaw russia love looking guy named stamper goetz otto pretty awesome although bit stiff well mostly posture really 
 bit comedy get cameo vincent shiavelli german austrian assassin ordered bond one point 
 government people small parts usual q desmond llewelyn looking near death sadly getting one scene grouchy mood usual m judi dench getting m usually gets mean judi dench 
 reason whatsoever except cause good goldeneye joe don baker shows wade admitting reason time annoying 
 oh well 
 action sequences letdown although sometimes go long 
 pop every now mainly sake series significant ones opening one one garage bmw runs remote control motorcylce chase bmw cycle nonetheless china streets vietnam 
plots really essential 
theyre hightech feature much laughs yeah dig 
 theyre distracting theyre supposed 
 acting around great 
yeoh actually one better bond girls mainly shes unique 
 better bond girls independent certain wilyness 
pussy galore homoerotic undertones one best diana rigg married bond end majestys secret service killed added emotional depth 
yeoh notable since shes active great chemistry brosnan 
pryce awesome villain slimy lovable time 
 brosnan mack daddy 
 bond series built cliches mainly theyre fun add escapism 
 can remember dalton years theyre serious direction remember unsuccessful financially aesthetically 
 series falter bogged much plot many themes much characterization 
 dont really understand yet im one bigger fans series northeast united states 
 seen yes ive seen twice already can tell adore 
 one best like goldfinger russia love tomorrow never dies nonetheless truly awesome installment even fully amazing better ones
