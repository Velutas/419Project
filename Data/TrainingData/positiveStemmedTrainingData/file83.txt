 big surprise 
 good trailer hinted pulled impossible making blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi dumb idea really hope 
 replaced just fine 
 john goodman didnt much anything brilliant actor joe morton can really sing 
 fourth blues brother j evan bonifant whos ten 
 another fears film hes really good dancer plays mean harmonica although may dubbed 
things intellectually bothered like mission god everyone richer filmed chicago gave problems 
im quite pleased less car pileups meant less music john landis seems lost interest whole thing 
theres early crashes one huge pileup stops 
 just music 
one problems first cab calloways song good actually blues brothers look dull theres problems 
 music good ever tons great musicians showing exception johnny lang cant sing musicians great job 
 real problems special effects 
 superfluous waste money 
since film isnt well mean possibility another sequel want see 
 bluegrass version riders sky even better rawhide
