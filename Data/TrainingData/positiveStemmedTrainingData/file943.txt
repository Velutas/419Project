 always refreshing see superstar actor gets paid enough forget working living want take chance play lessthansavoury character mel gibson payback 
 course paid million one months work id probably willing take risks well thats neither 
payback based novel richard stark apparently actually donald e westlake author grifters fine crime film also filmed s point blank starring one toughest tough guys lee marvin 
 film opens gibson recovered shot several times back dont know yet 
 know gibson porter isnt happy chappy hellbent getting money stolen back getting even process matter consequences 
 turns man hes val gregg henry sometime partner stole briefcase full cash gang chinese mobsters 
obviously much crisis soul val figures porter dead goes using share money pay debt employers 
porter however sort man holds grudge feet goes exacting revenge doublecrossing val 
gibson gives terrific performance sort role born play slightly unhinged guy doesnt mind beating shooting people get wants 
 probably wouldnt see actors salary range take offbeat outofcharacter role porter jim carrey wont anything like hurry happened last time tried cable guy anyone 
harrison fords idea playing unsympathetic character presumed innocent last time schwarzenegger played villain batman robin wont mention stallone ever really played villain 
 say porter villain per se 
 isnt sort character wouldnt want get wrong side hes nothing compared ones forced watch countless bad thrillers action films kill innocent people blink eye execute righthand men just prove mean 
porter trying get back notsorightfully way almost understandable 
payback enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller wont remembered among gibsons important work still one finer films hes done 
 real problem everything seems work end left feeling something lacking 
 ending looks tacked last minute final voiceover doesnt ring true even though used good effect elsewhere filmnoir style rest film embodies 
 film just ends far suddenly huge buildup penultimate scenes 
 fine film even though needs just little something kind film can recommended without hesitation 
just ready possible letdown ending
