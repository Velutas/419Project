confession time never ever seen gone wind 
 dont know really 
havent wanted check video havent home nights network tv far drive last time bigscreen 
 right front ill admit dont know heck im talking goes 
 titanic gone wind s 
maybe thats going little bit far 
 good job leonardo dicaprio kate winslet movie theyre clark gable vivien leigh 
 
 parallels 
gwtw first movie take real advantage revolutionary technology available technicolor 
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward seamlessly integrating computer graphic design actors 
gwtw places americas greatest tragedy background classic love story titanic atlantics legendary tragedy 
 strongwilled redheaded heroines exploit class differences aristocracy slavessteerage bums incredibly expensive popular 
ok maybe thats enough parallels 
 titanics gwtws league 
 matter 
titanic great movie right complete spills thrills especially chills 
much made humongous cost production care went making huge luxury liner come alive 
 money obviously wellspent 
 costumes look great sets look great cgi graphics look great 
 especially liked expensive little touches like spending tons money authentic titanic china break floor ship sinks 
 writerdirectorproducer james camerons real challenge writingdirecting producing titanic wasnt just costuming set design special effects 
camerons major headache keeping audience interested tale everybody knows ending going 
 succeeds masterfully 
cameron two things work incredibly well 
first shows us modernday salvage operations titanic thats just titanic titanic mind 
 first glimpse get titanic ship present state corroding slowly away hammering pressure north atlantic window minisub piloted treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton 
television coverage exploration titanic intrigues yearold rose calvert gloria stuart survived wreck 
stuart phenomenal job brief role narrating story experience stunned paxton roughneck crew 
secondly cameron keeps storyline focused almost exclusively rose character romantic triangle rose winslet bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio 
 way bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong allstar cast see impact disaster wide group people 
cameron wisely chooses stick rose jack paying scant heed celebrities board 
 supporting cast professional mostly anonymous kathy bates unsinkable molly brown theres moment stop say oh yeah know whats 
 although like seen colm meaney white star uniform even illfated engineer 
 love story rather conventional 
 think reviewers found weak may fair criticism 
 performances key 
zane meatiest part movie plays arrogant condescending steel millionaire hilt 
hes smooth looks great tuxedo hes convincing enough jerk winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible 
 moment sees little girl frightened get aboard lifeboat can hear wheels mind turning saying can save little girl 
 can help get lifeboat 
dicaprio revelation 
 hadnt seen anything didnt know heck expect really 
 honestly expected bad irish accent cameron evidently decided bad idea dicaprio plays poor american artist wins ticket poker game 
dicaprio exhibits infectious joy alive titanic hard like 
 moment ship leaves port hits iceberg dicaprio carry movie keep interest never falters 
winslets character grows lot movie performance 
 first shes required anything wear period clothing look dropdead gorgeous 
 know narration shes monstrously unhappy arranged marriage zane isnt expression feelings encounters dicaprio 
winslet dicaprio develop chemistry manages propel movie along ship hits iceberg 
 moment winslets character really comes alive 
faced real danger drops spoiledrichgirl mannerisms splendid job 
 rose jack race around doomed ship looking shelter freezing water cals fiery temper winslet turns superb acting performance mixing courage compassion anger sheer shrieking terror 
 course interesting character ship 
cameron clearly fallen love titanic shows every mood deserted wreck boiler room bridge hold captains table steerage manages bring great ship back dead 
camerons greatest gift allows us fall love titanic well
