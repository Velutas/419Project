 thirteenth floor third call reality check movie series similar reality check movies released year matrix existenz 
 three made think made wonder real isnt world just huge game 
 thirteenth floor doesnt reach level originality creativity curiosity sparked matrix existenz certainly gives great shot 
 matrix told humans simply virus 
 existenz learned life just game 
 thirteenth floor learn just electronic devices living another world electronic devices 
 just one world top another everything fake electronically generated 
 thirteenth floor took huge risky turn didnt expect take im sure great turn make 
rather focusing just reality parts film thirteenth floor becomes murder mystery ends tying different worlds 
 mysterious murder computer program designer hammond fuller played armin muellerstahl douglas hall played craig bierko man worked fuller many years must travel electronic computer device fuller using year consists computer generated characters 
 simulation just like back olden days 
 people involved just characters 
douglas strongly believes character traveled transport world killed fuller 
along way douglas interacts many different potential suspects woman claims daughter fuller jane fuller played wonderfully talented young actress gretchen mol 
 thirteenth floor plot driven movie time film gets going doesnt use spectacular special effects big sound keep viewers interests 
 worried film much like matrix existenz wouldnt enjoy enough twists turns keep thinking attentive film 
unfortunately many potential great scenes thrown away predictable content letting viewer know outcome scene long happened 
 scenes arent original interesting seem go absolutely nowhere leaving wondering point 
sometimes hard believe story terrible dialogue bad acting especially craig bierko scenes go absolutely nowhere actually true 
 know isnt true story anything film able make think 
 plus side acting get see missing main character action since film masterpiece shine actor armin muellerstahl 
 thirteenth floor back still giving believable amazing performances 
another plus gretchen mols realistic performance creating character depth just staying onedimensional phase 
dont expect intensity matrix existenz come thirteenth floor just expect another film messes mind awhile shuts like movie 
thrills chills spills arent will get film will just get another trip send mind scrambling youve enough 
 bottom line lets hope last reality check based movies awhile
