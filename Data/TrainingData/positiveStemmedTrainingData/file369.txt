titanic without doubt best movie ive seen year 
 believe im easy critic impress english patient long men black overhyped several big summer releases dead water 
thank god film got delayed december 
 christmas present 
titanic tradition old hollywood epics yearsgoneby truly stunning film 
 watching picture completely mesmerized never taking eyes screen checking watch see much longer gonna last despite hour plus running time 
 friend mine whos true titanicbuff said someone doesnt like film didnt want 
truer words hard come 
 course doesnt hurt film comes one favorite directors james cameron unarguably greatest action director time 
 wish argue point look list credits terminator aliens abyss terminator true lies etc still care disagree 
 cameron helmed directorial duties film also wrote produced edited 
 show true faith project renenged directing fees percentage points ease budget costs 
 obvious truly loves titanic 
 film opens footage real fake underwater excursion special submarines bottom atlantic team explorers lead bill paxton searcing diamond called heart ocean according bill paxtons character worth hope diamond today 
 search turns dissapointly diamond instead drawing young woman wearing diamond 
 picture broadcast cnn seen year old woman named rose claims girl picture 
 flown sea meet bill paxton tell diamond 
almost rest movie narration past 
roses narration shows us unhappy young girl engaged rich man named cal hockley billy zane didnt want marry 
 mother pushy obnoxious cal hockley arrogant 
 boarding titanic sailing america marry cal 
meanwhile young man named jack dawson leonardo dicaprio italian friend danny nucci win two rd class tickets aboard titanic poker game 
 overjoyed rush aboard just boat leaving 
 ticket america better life 
 rose sailing doom 
 first hour half titanic tells story rose dewitt kate winslet jack dawson fall love 
 classic wrongsideofthetracks story sometimes resort cliches 
 said love portion isnt sappy doesnt weigh film critics said 
 sweet didnt make restless despite fact usually hate love stories 
 course might help cameron introduces pretty interesting characters help keep eyes glued screen 
 people actually passengers titanic back including enigmatic molly brown played talented kathy bates captain titanic bernard hill 
 characters add extra depth film make easier watch 
 course things really start get going hour half mark titanic strikes iceberg begins slow sink bottom 
 sinking depicted realisticly effects truly amazing 
 told heroic fashion sense either people portrayed panicking pushing others aside get limited lifeboats drowning dying horrible deaths 
 best part movie opinion comes end flash back future 
 crew first skeptical roses story now totally aborbed 
rose goes onto ships ledge learn secret catches us guard 
 see dream roses returns titanic dancing jack dawson 
 people talked movie saw dream 
however think symbolized think meant rose died going sort heaven happiest part life one true love jack 
 anyone seen movie like voice opinion email venomhotmail com
