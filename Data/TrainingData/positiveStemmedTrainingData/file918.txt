critique good ol time movies 
heres film actually gives away plotline trailer doesnt really bring anything new forefront youve seen flicks like duel breakdown youve crossed path still manages entertain gangbusters realistic situations believable characters funny moments thrills chills whole shebang 
lets give director john dahl continues put solid films every year havent seen red rock west favor right now jot piece paper rent earliest convenience 
 much like film one excellent premise sets everything even pace 
 gives little bit background main three characters shows one small prank can lead whole lotta trouble everyone 
paul walker really surprised movie since ive never much thought anything pretty face damn ever pretty

 arrow practically others arms well maybe im exaggerating catch drift minute brought another turn events turn took even higher level 
 kudos director dahl able generate type intensity suspense tension great score editing style camerawork
