logical time travel movies nearimpossibility 
considering skeptics best argument possibility time travel idea altered realities writing script deals problem imposing task 
occasionally get film manage 
terry gilliams monkeys one film 
 frequently get films dont much deal 
 one question ask case film virtues override existing logical inconsistencies 
 terminator films made exciting action back future entertaining story new film frequency pulls trick strong package 
 frequency filled plot holes 
yes 
 matter 
 really 
 film opens october 
firefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts life line every time suits job goes home loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell son johnny daniel henson 
 doublepronged story flashes forward johnny now jim caviezel grown working police detective 
 strange occurrence appearance aurora borealis new york city allows father son communicate ham radio frank used john found present day 
though initially skeptical idea john eventually takes opportunity warn father impending death warehouse fire succeeds saving frank certain doom 
now flooded memories full life father alive john initially overjoyed discovers changes timeline disastrous serial killer died instead lived kill seven women 
frank john now must work together set things right john using information gathered future instruct frank past 
 premise frequency unusual requires getting one important mental hurdle fully accept john frank ones conscious timeline changed result actions 
 isnt explained just go 
 frank doesnt die fire john one remembers differently everyone else remembers new way 
 concept also runs problems concerning just synchronous two realities 
sometimes franks changing past results something happening right away johns world sometimes john gets changes ahead time 
now filmmakers might perfectly good explanations probably come something fairly convoluted nevertheless logical thought hard enough example reason john gets advance information serial killers murders change already happened franks world john witnessing projection change explanations arent really point 
 frequency gets cooking riveting little thriller even confusing 
 matters film like plot makes sense moment frequency works long keeps moving 
 film manages engaging despite logical confusion 
director gregory hoblit screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care setting goal reached conflict resolved 
 liked many creative touches split screens allowing us see universe affected realities greater framework baseball drive action forward 
 actually uses metsorioles world series one featured amazin mets great effect frank uses johns advance knowledge series outcome convince friends believe 
 admittedly device may interest baseball fan like 
 even liked final scene features frank john fighting man simultaneously different time periods 
 may find scene blindingly confusing reality shifts start coming fast furious make sense think give script lot leeway lets face darn cool way end film 
 enough surprises plot twists frequency keep toes result movie avoids growing stagnant 
 major thing appreciate frequency handling fatherson relationship 
quaid caviezel carry parts easily rocksolid job actors 
 relationship instantly credible find human truth behind high concept one react able communicate dead relative future descendant 
watching exchanges frank john will give pretty good idea answer question 
 credibility human relationship absolutely crucial rest film dont believe characters dont care outcome thriller plot 
 care like lead actors 
 also liked supporting cast members 
elizabeth mitchell gets stuck two thankless roles playing julia doting wife mother still performs admirably 
andre braugher late television show homicide life street gives nice supporting turn franks best friend future colleague john 
 lovely scene diner tries explain situation julia franks world series predictions come true eyes 
braugher strikes perfect facial expression simultaneously dismayed amused 
perhaps thing didnt like frequency overly sentimental coda cameras focus goes little soft baseball theme gets carried overboard 
 thats film already earned poignancy without resorting cheap tactics 
 freely acknowledge frequency may best work guy movie since focuses maleoriented idea fatherson relationships echoes field dreams can easily heard underlying concept universally applicable 
 wouldnt want speak longdead parent 
 see children turn 
 tell life son excuse mist 
 dont call sissy
