although first mission impossible film moderate box office success audiences panned felt plot confusing wasnt much action although fan series old new thought movie pretty decent especially gutsy make phelps bad guy 
 problem rectified sequel making plot accessible courtesy one writers previous entry robert towne turning film one gigantic action set piece steady hand action film guru john woo 
 end result one entertaining yet simple action films made long 
unfortunately first forty minutes relatively slow dwelling mainly ethan nyahs quickly blossoming romance seeming place james bond film less glamorous mission impossible tv series 
ethans conflict compelling one seems rushed comes near fatal car wreck ethan causes 
john woo handles artistic flair seems place featuring great deal slow fades dramatically framed closeups 
 surreal nature sequences distracting ultimately detriment film 
thankfully though point ambrose discovers nyahs deception mission impossible ii becomes entertaining actionpacked 
robert townes screenplay takes conventions set first film parodies sequence ethan must break highrise building retrieve remaining specimens virus 
 action scenes just begin build intensity case many woos previous highoctane films 
 final half hour assault action good deal ruined trailer unfortunately 
 far summer entertainment goes mission impossible ii serviceable fare 
anyone looking hardcore action wont disappointed except first half film perhaps 
even werent fan first film entry deserves checking
