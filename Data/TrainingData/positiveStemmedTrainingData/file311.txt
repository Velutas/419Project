 find television intensely boring simply never turn set unless im watching movie 
 dont even cable went radio shack buy antenna specifically purpose watching xfiles every sunday night 
 show thats worth hour time week though since dont watch reruns im glad six months year avoid television altogether 
 avid fan show three years now 
 love gillian anderson 
 xfiles film continues story season finale left 
 film like twohour episode except lot special effects plot thicker resolution satisfying 
 terrific film fans series never seen imagine viewers unfamiliar show will find film solid riveting entertainment 
 expected like episode ive seen expectations met 
actually film takes risks story plot devices thankfully makers managed right 
 finale ended fbi branch known xfiles destroyed heroes mulder david duchovny scully gillian anderson left stripped five years hard work 
 film picks soon mulder scully reduced field agents investigating bomb threat federal building 
 wait im getting ahead 
 film actually opens ice age years prior couple prehistoric guys get attacked vicious alien 
 aliens blood infects fans show will certainly remember black cancer story jumps modern times young boy also infected cancer 
 turns bomb planted kill boy mulder scully uncover coverup despite fact scully resigned position fbi 
soon find whole thing aliens 
 ive written easy write plot summaries films like everything needs surprise 
fans show will know expect seriously doubt disappointed film 
director rob bowman done great job expanding eerie feeling show big screen making small adjustments minor changes utilize possibilities film allows television 
 truly suspenseful wellcreated scenes late film theyre alien spacecraft youll see one better action sequences recent cinema 
 special effects good production design christopher nowak fantastic 
 find interesting xfiles actually great way series neophytes get story 
 heroes given subtle introductions expected know outset film explains enough story prior knowledge series isnt required understand film 
 course little elements makers included payoff fans ill keep surprises 
 takes lot thought understanding series create film using roots complicated ones series provides create coherent film anyone can understand clearly 
 series strong lot reasons 
 original though many ties twilight zone owes homage hitchcock impressively eerie television show 
 really makes series shine however actors 
duchovny much presence just fun guy watch 
 confidence will someday make bankable leading man 
anderson equally good paralyzingly beautiful shes also strong actress 
 performers acted little series however though think theyll get chances prove soon 
 enthusiastically recommend xfiles fans nonfans 
 summer filled disappointing blockbusters film satisfy others leave completely dry 
 intelligent film takes places might least might seen many times feel familiar 
 xfiles impressive concept well fans series likely highly critical take premise beyond series risky move 
 nice see risk pay change 
actually nice see risk
