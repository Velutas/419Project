will hunting matt damon natural genius 
 movie character thats usually death sentence 
 trait associated brother calls good world movies like phenomenon powder 
forgive spoiling ending will doesnt die 
 formula movie 
 fact quite fresh original 
 character study anything thats surprising considering written two actors damon costar ben affleck 
will works whatever kind job can get 
first hes janitor works construction 
offscreen speed reads books academic subject interests 
onscreen hangs friends picking fights robust romanticizedhemingway fashion 
lambeau stellan skarsgard breaking waves math professor learns janitor will genius special talent advanced mathematics 
 confirmed hes fluke savant can get will education system 
 firmly rejected 
finally will lands jail one fights 
lambeau can get probation instead prison time long will agrees therapy sessions discussing mathematics 
will barely decides go therapy prison 
lambeau treats will like son 
hes proud amazed wills accomplishments mathematics 
 encourages will tries give structure knowing little discipline bigger einstein 
will isnt really interested academia 
 knows best field therefore spend time office explaining math people like lambeau 
 rather work construction breaks lambeaus heart 
meanwhile will attends mandated therapy sessions 
 long shreds therapists lambeaus list 
will read enough psychology know tricks trade keep affecting 
shrink shrink refuses return wills mockery 
lambeaus last hope old college roommate now psychology teacher smalltime community college 
knowing will going try shred sean robin williams agrees take favor lambeau chance meet next einstein 
true form will finds seans emotional weakness attacks 
 unlike shrinks sean knows continues sessions 
like foster mother fussy child sean knows attacks defensive able take stride 
like foster mother sean knows time quiet patience approach 
robin williams excellent role 
hes actor great range right roles great depth 
 movie awakenings comes point quiet shy man accomplishes something great personal importance smile pure joy spreads eyes 
williams actor can name can make audience cry just smiling 
 compared will foster child thats entirely fair 
emotionally lot learn child 
 thought life made rational decisions wants 
sean girlfriend pals lambeau help grow didnt start asking particularly needing help 
 exceptional gift singled love kept pushing right direction 
 say anything bad good will hunting walks line drama melodrama 
 sentimental uplifiting straight drama emotions subtle melodrama 
 emotionally engaging quite larger life 
 isnt problem per se times didnt know quite take 
 relatively small complaint good movie 
 good movie allows characters learn grow 
 doesnt just happen takes good script good acting good direction
