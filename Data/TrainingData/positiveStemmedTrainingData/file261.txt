 breed apart casts rutger hauer crazy birdloving recluse picks feathered friends kathleen turner 
 bit hard swallow 
thats first many improbabilities film 
hauer stars man obsessed keeping birds island safe boothe plays guy hired steal couple rare eagle eggs rich egg collector 
turner woman caught two men 
 breed apart isnt bad movie exactly 
indeed found rooting hauer boothe characters even though goals couldnt different 
 problem film just many inconsistencies 
 example early film hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting birds 
later rednecks come back revenge four people hauer kills 
 tough time believing police wouldnt get involved point 
another problem silly lovetriangle develops 
 didnt care one way ended turner 
 interested finding two men victorious respective missions 
however despite uninteresting subplot turner manage give great performance woman reminds two men sometimes theres life money birds 
 hauer hes actor ive always admired 
 penchant picking strange unusual characters 
 one exception 
hes frequently seen riding around island white horse wearing pirates clothing holstering crossbow 
despite eccentric mannerisms though hauer always manages let human side character shine 
 example theres scene barks turner son came onto island day early 
 comes crazy loner scene minutes later apologizing turner believe intentions 
soon find hes vietnam vet actions become fairly clear us 
 breed apart isnt great movie means contain good performances three leads worth seeing reason alone
