 bought soundtrack really quite surprised different sounded disney features 
 never really heard phil collins heard mark mancina wondering two make disney flick spin 
 pleasantly surprised music topnotch 
phil collins songs terrific percussionheavy pieces work seem break formula typical disney songs 
 score mark mancina also neat reminded bit lion king original 
 soundtrack wasnt bad considering two people familiar 
 film good 
 will 
 finally went see opening day tend disney animated features question answered complete turnabout expectations disneys tarzan surprisingly decent 
 story starts tarzans parents surviving shipwreck finding home island apes live peace 
however one day vicious leopard sabor attacks kills tarzans parents leaving time baby aloneuntil kala apes rescues 
kala wants raise child lost previously sabor mate kerchak sure 
 kind says 
 agrees though let take care little tarzan doesnt make son 
tarzan grows vowing best ape ever matter hard tries guidance hilarious ape friend terk just cant convince kerchak one apes even defeats sabor battle 
one day new animal shows humans 
 jane comes picture 
 expedition father professor porter despicable hunter clayton searching gorillas 
tarzan rescues chased baboons soon get know 
even though tarzan falls love jane causes things go wrong 
clayton tricks tarzan taking jane porter see apes convinced betrayed 
worse clayton plotted send gorillas london money 
will tarzan find family belongs save apes 
im gonna tell sorry 
youre gonna see 
 see animation always top notch particularly tarzan goes soaring trees read skateboarding 
 deep canvas computer generated effect adds authentic feeling jungle tarzan lives 
 fact seems similar computer imagerycel animation combination rival disney animted films foxs anastasia dreamworks prince egypt 
 disney actually taking ideas rivals 
 casting fairly good 
tony goldwyn emotionally believeable tarzan relief animators succeeded making another hercules 
nicely done glenn close wonderful kala beautiful singing voice way 
lance henrikson kerchak somewhat reminds robby bensons beast voice makes ferocious gripping 
minnie driver little worried first voice jane 
 thought annoying voice whole film first saw trailers saw film didnt problem 
 take back insult driver 
 nice hear nigel hawthorne another voice disney animated feature fflewdurr flamm disneys underrated classic black cauldron funny delightful professor porter 
 villiany side voices brian blessed guy boss nass star wars episode ithe phantom menace brings pompous later vicious voice sinister clayton 
 might strongest character film hes just plain bad guy nothing else blesseds vocal work contributes greatly 
 voice think steals whole show rosie odonnell hilariously funny terk 
 also fiesty attitude im gonna kill ya 
 says 
 almost sung along one films best moments apes make mess humans camp via song er scatting shoobedoo dabedah 
 can see wanted rock song film shes good singer 
 funny character film though 
wayne knight played stan space jam gives whimsically funny style tantor elephant especially worried stepping unsanitary water 
 thankfully real sound flatuencethat killed picture 
 songs said decent mostly sung collins 
 sets new standard disney animated films first time characters sing 
 tolerate musical numbers characters lot guys found nice change pace 
 story elements comedy also load strong dramatic touches makes film far better unbelieveably uninspired hercules 
 anything disappointing tarzan might omission n sync version trashing camp film 
 heard soundtrack wondered going 
 upset wasnt thought taking friends mine like n sync see tarzan 
oh well 
overall enthralled tarzan 
 wouldnt hold high way mulan hunchback notre dame alltime favorite disney classics film deserves high place among disneys greatest achievements 
 give nod disney following spectacular masterpiece mulan great animated adaption egar rice burroughs tarzan
