armageddon symbolizes everything wrong modern filmmaking 
stories replaced special effects character development gets overshadowed bad dialogue plotting consists bunch shit getting blown 
armageddon stupid loud shallow movie youll see come summer maybe even summer 
 loved every freaking minute 
believe im just shocked 
hell dont even know went see first place 
 previews annoying predicted going worst film year least running 
im sorry somebody dial 
isnt quite tagging thats going sell movie 
 isnt wise either market film using movies stupidest lines beam scotty yeah sure great writing 
 mean lets face armageddons previews rival truman shows worst year 
neither even come close respective films justice 
 course know story 
 earth threatened total annihilation via asteroid size texas nasa calls uss top oil drillers go space implant nuclear device eighthundred someodd feet asteroid 
 coarse mayhem introduced interesting interesting characters 
belonging former group rockhound steve buscemi horny little womanizing genius whos always full wisecracks even flying space huge amount gs 
also theres always coolashell billy bob thornton dan truman bigwig nasa recruits drillers 
 kind reminded ed harris apollo without intensity great lines deliver 
 flip side coin tired contrived character harry stamper bruce willis whole movie employing annoying accent cant quite place leader pack well liv tyler ben affleck token lovers must summer movie 
basically thats 
 said hardly film plot 
 another summer blockbuster plot points beyond unbelievable dialogue characters mostly completely wooden 
case point nasa doesnt know even asteroid way eighteen days impact huh 
another example one point movie two children playing toy space shuttles front poster kennedy 
 pretentious 
want another one 
okay oil drillers blast space one starts singing leaving jet plane soon rest join 
 michael bay attend school sappy filmmaking made picture 
 naturally sappiness melodrama special effects accumulate one bitchin time movies 
 dont get wrong despite things found wrong armageddon still much enjoyed 
 even dont win one mcdonalds free tickets still definitely worth checking
