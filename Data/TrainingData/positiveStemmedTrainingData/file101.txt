james l brooks one developers simpsons director broadcast news returns big screen entertaining slightly flawed comedy 
nicholson plays melvin udall probably horrible person ever screen 
hes racist homophobic never good word say anyone 
 nobody talks except waitress carol conelly t v 
sitcom star hunt last seen twister 
naturally udall conelly gay neighbor simon bishop kinnear nicholson hates hit end 
like good will hunting titanic even though outcome completely obvious good gets enjoyable funny warm comedy 
nicholson hilarious melvin churning insults superb relish 
 nicholson get away lines melvin delivers 
hunt also good waitress carol easily rises challenge nicholson 
theres also thankfully bit chemistry 
kinnear gay neighbor seems slightly underwritten role hes plot convience character 
although performance good character just seems exist help melvin carol come together 
 fact scene stealer simons dog funnier nicholson 
 pets always cute screen 
providing solid support cuba gooding jnr jerry maguire yeardly smith voice lisa simpsons simpsons although gooding isnt good character maguire still fun 
 overacts little much annoying 
smith also good although fairly small role 
even director lawrence kasdan body heat makes appearance doctor 
 primarily nicholsons film every scene hes hes steals 
hes character hateful though amazing anyone talks especially carol 
 films main problem 
 totally unbelievable carol ever consider liking melvin 
 doesnt fall love naturally film forces fall love 
also melvins character seems go nice quickly 
 doubt anyone character like melvins able turn back nice loving person 
 take helluva long time much longer film like make 
brooks direction good though bit average usually manages get emotion audience 
 handles comedy scenes better sentimental ones tends pile much schmaltz generally hes good 
theres also nice soundtrack veteran composer hans zimmer 
 generally good gets achieves sets make audience feel good end movie 
 movie bit overlong nicholson good fun running time passes pretty quickly 
overall good gets fun movie even though may unbelivable certainly worth seeing just jack nicholsons performance 
 quite good gets pardon bad joke still good fun
