countries legal systems take rule law principle seriously forbidden judges juries make judgements matters involve personally 
luckily movie reviewers arent burdened legislation 
otherwise small pool special movies forever ignored reviewer 
 case star wars science fiction epic george lucas consequences even severe film special tens millions hundreds millions fans 
 case objectivity something seldom seen star wars reviews undisputed majority reviewers rate one best best film times 
 dont usually difficulties hiding artistic snobbery 
 author review must also concede inability use cold objective standards reviewing film 
like many previous reviewers must note watched star wars first time twenty years ago remained enchanted experience ever since 
perhaps childlike fascination unimaginable wonders happened long time ago galaxy far away 
 perhaps rush felt minutes opening shots expectations already pumped serialised comic books novelisation read 
anyway watching star wars one important movie going experiences life 
 also unmatched many years come movies managed strong impact like george lucas epic 
star wars wasnt just important movie millions fans probably share sentiment 
 defining moment history modern cinema 
 american motion picture industry limbo social turmoil s practically destroyed old hollywood new authors filled void mostly using hollywoods financial technical resources create serious personal artsy movies 
 result audience traumatised dark reality vietnam watergate didnt want see dark serious content silver screen 
george lucas science fiction epic among first come rescue 
 audience responded unprecedented enthusiasm huge financial success movie later backed supplement industry toys books comics role playing games merchandise slowly began change face hollywood 
serious adult movies artistic ambitions faded oblivion replaced industrial products blockbuster philosophy 
one biggest casualties trend science fiction movie genre 
 science fiction movies mostly bproduction domain 
 late s bigger budgets science fiction didnt look strange anymore thanks great success space odyssey 
 success coincided surge pesimism hollywood science fiction bleak rest production mostly dark dystopic movies 
however star wars showed genre can inspiration popular movies even among audience usually doesnt like 
 result seriousness cinematic science fiction began fading away although good dark cult quality sf continued filmed early s 
 science fiction continued considered synonym family entertainment 
ironically man responsible star wars time considered member new hollywood generation young movie authors made artsy personal films early s 
george lucas established dystopic sf movie thx nostalgic drama american graffiti 
 movies considered personal time despite latter one becoming popular 
 sense star wars also personal film thorny way final production shows commercial considerations 
 unlike many personal movies era personality line wishes general audience 
 plot set long time ago galaxy far away begins time civil war 
 evil empire threatened rebels want restore old republic

 small band comes colourful spaceport moss eisely hire spaceship owned rogue pilot han solo harrison ford furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew 
critics dont like movie especially cant forgive lucas contribution quashing new hollywood prone point lack originality 
 surface might right lucas admits found lot inspiration lore old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials s s yet obvious element akira kurosawas samurai classic hidden fortress 
 hand spent last two decades studying movie death say inspiration star wars went even collective subconscious western civilisation hinted mild tolkien references 
 others find authors element within story star wars seen anti establishment film young longhaired easy going natureloving heroes fighting old uptight oppressive forces use supertechnology demonic purposes 
even historical social context star wars impressive strictly technical piece seven art 
george lucas direction good clever editing wellpaced segments action dramatic buildup 
characters welldrawn deliver necessary ingredients space opera hollywood blockbuster 
 comingofage hero damselindistress somewhat toned due popular feminist trends time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain finally comic relief form two nonhuman characters 
 actors good alec guiness famous role date james earl jones whose voice enough cause unease peter cushing incarnation pure evil human form 
unfortunately cant said main leads among main trio mark hamill carrie fisher harrison ford last one character threedimensional enough launch acting career 
 thing looked like important segment star wars phenomena initial release new level special effects technology 
often comparisons space odyssey another groundbreaking sf film citing sheer number effects proof lucas superiority kubrick 
however special effects john dykstra john stears indeed impressive even two decades although special edition improve significantly yet arent remembered trademark movie 
 honour definitely go oscar winning soundtrack john williams whose work star wars probably brightest gem brilliant career 
newer generations viewers might somewhat deprived enchantment still holds lucky enough witness star wars original release 
yet even immune george lucas magic watch film nevertheless perhaps become familiar something essential part contemporary culture
