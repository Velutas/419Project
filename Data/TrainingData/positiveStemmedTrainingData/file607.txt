star trek insurrection ninth star trek movie third focus star trek next generation crew 
star trek insurrection qualifies one movies star trek fans rate somewhere okay good 
 star trek v final frontier nearly awful movie almost bad repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans probably swallow anything paramount throws trek film franchise 
 dont wish spend review comparing insurrection eight trek movies 
 people reading probably havent followed star trek anyway comparison seem tedious best 
let thus make comparisons briefly system star trek insurrection good previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrections comic tone may best compared star trek iv voyage home star trek ii wrath khan still best trek movie 
okay lets move movie 
star trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanitys exploration colonization space lot lowbrow humor witty oneliners 
 combination works well often fails fail humor really seems cheesy 
much film appeals trek fans nostalgic fondness starship enterprises crew 
audiences unfamiliar trek lore may miss significance plot points may even become confused times 
star trek insurrection begins scenes tranquil life baku homeworld 
forget actors special effects beautiful setting movie snowy mountaintops verdant valleys steals show 
 tranquility however broken data android reveals baku secretly monitored federation alien allies sona 
 seems world veritable fountain youth sustaining inhabitants indefinantly young healthy state 
 enterprise crew led captain picard investigates datas actions uncovers conspiracy sona enterprise admiral relocate baku plunder planets youthrestoring properties 
sound pretty heavy 
 though plot anything unique groundbreaking undermined films constant barrage humor 
 going data instance picard sings opera piece supposed cute humorous 
 much funny sequence work grows large pimple side nose result exposure baku homeworld pimple crewmates try might avoid looking 
 acting star trek insurrection part pretty good 
since theyve playing characters years portraying enterprise crew reassume roles effortlessly enough 
 terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard delivers moral speech picards trademark usual aplomb 
brent spiner another fine actor plays android data well enough provides best moments comic relief film though old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire trek fans familiar routine tv series 
 supporting cast appear movie alone also pretty good 
despite many critics negative opinions f murray abraham winner academy award performance amadeus plays major villain ruafro well enough 
ruafro reminds somewhat baron harkonnen film version dune 
like baron ruafro continuously skin looked stretched stapled servants 
 one particularly memorable scene ruafro becomes agitated facial skin splits open bleeds 
ruafro khan star trek iithe best trek villain everbut much better forgettable dr soran star trek generations 
 okay promise comparisons 
donna murphy must also noted baku woman anij picard falls love 
murphy young woman supermodel body mature woman attractive countenance 
 type woman picard know character well enchanted 
 fact chemistry murphy stewart works well 
 particular plot point involving anijs ability slow time ability shares picard becomes one intriguing parts movie 
 good actors setting star trek insurrections special effects surprisingly disappointing 
 proved adequate sometimes barely s mainstream science fiction film fell way short standard trek movie paled comparison seen trailer star wars phantom menace trailer reportedly preceded many showings insurrection 
 space battles involving enterprise sona ships particular seemed trite unsuspenseful final confrontation picard ruafro took place completely unconvincing interior satellite 
 new enterprise seen film predecessor remains largely unexplored though exterior doesnt look quite right reason explain 
despite star trek insurrections frequent comic goofiness occasional substandard special effects enjoyed film 
 maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view future rejects gritty violence predecessors particularly star trek first contact though dont get wrong dark tones trek films like first contact can work successfully 
id recommend insurrection matinee film saturday afternoon especially fans trek science fiction general 
rated pg cant see film objectionable viewing audience young old
