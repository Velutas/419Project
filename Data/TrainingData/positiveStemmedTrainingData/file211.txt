 must say outset never much kurt russell fan 
ive seen films silkwood backdraft unlawful entry gave adequate performances never impressed work 
breakdown something surprise 
russell gives fine performance cast one upstaged action orchestrated second half film 
 say holds film together completely true harm 
russell plays jeff one half married couple travelling wife amy kathleen quinlan cross country san diego start new job new life 
 journeying desert car breaks left helpless stranded jeff waves passing truck driver j t 
walsh offers take nearby diner call tow truck 
 nasty incident earlier couple ruffians jeff decides stay car amy gets help 
 seems last time jeff anyone else sees 
breakdown compared several movies george sluizers vanishing original hopefully appalling hollywood remake steven spielbergs duel number hitchcock films 
 breakdown part stray conventional path american actionthriller 
jeff become guntoting vigilante hunt wife instead becomes scared confused everyman idea hell going 
 find happened amy come slight disappointment early film one done extra twenty minutes mystery bewilderment affects film little 
russell mentioned earlier good role kathleen quinlan nowhere near annoying apollo 
j t 
walsh possibly evil truck driver terrific one best fine batch character actors hollywood doesnt seem know director jonathan mostow right track 
 reason makes great villain actually looks like real person one anyone able trust makes plot much believable 
breakdown hollywood doesnt make enough great thriller believable characters scenes indeed viewers edge seats 
one genuinely exciting films ive seen long time
