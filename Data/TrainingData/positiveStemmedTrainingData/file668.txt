 seems thousands people like love george lucass trilogy star wars movies grown time 
 fans freaks 
 wont go dressing like darth vader although admit imperial uniforms pretty darn cool wont incorporate lines script everyday conversations time anyway someone wants challenge us little trivia contest throwing 
 right stop looking like 
 faithfully patiently waiting 
waiting movie ever since end credits return jedi started roll 
 see trilogy just set movies religion sorts faithful disciples phantom menace tantamount second coming messiah 
unfortunately savior 
 weeks beforehand going around telling people movie better damned good stupendously good miraculously good 
anything less itll biggest disappointment century 
 didnt want doomsaying prophecy come true really didnt film nevertheless fails reach pinnacles filmmaking 
character development virtually nonexistent 
 possible exception quigon films characters seem left nothing go motions 
none seem affected experiences even show passion 
contrast horribly irritating comic relief nearly continuously subjected form jar jar binks creature belonging race lives underwater cities naboo precarious symbiosis land dwellers led amidala 
jar jars life saved quigon early film travels heroes sole reason making us laugh supposedly 
 speech mannerisms cuteified couldnt understand third saying slapstick performed just distracting 
 head gets caught electronic field foot gets caught stirrup large beast describes trouble deep doo doo even manages step walking around mos eisley spaceport 
therein lies key difference film one predecessors 
 star wars obiwan telling us mos eisley wretched hive scum villainy 
 phantom menace get doo doo 
 films trilogy took away everyday life immersed story long time ago galaxy far far away 
 film hand constantly reminds movie including situations phrases uniquely modern american seem incredibly place serve jerk viewer experience 
perhaps blatant offense occurs scene young anakin skywalker enters pod racing competition kind like chariot racing large engines instead horses couple commentators press box delivering indy like play play 
 liked pod race really exciting ratcheted tension heck lucas think idea putting sportscasters 
 race even exciting without distraction 
 aspect coupled emphasis humor simply baffled 
 suppose one may say lucas trying appeal younger viewer intelligent scenes dialog hurt appeal 
didnt millions youngsters still go back see original star wars 
didnt action figures still sell like hotcakes 
 course poor judgment allows mosteagerly awaited film history marred pandering children still enjoyed film appeal adults 
one aspect will appeal broadly however use special effects 
 people lucass industrial light magic worlds premiere effects house outdid providing seamless integration computergenerated images reallife footage 
 scenes seen believed especially shots land battle federations robot army jar jars countrymen 
 space battles also impressive although improved past efforts subtle margins casual observer 
 however testament work ilm produced two decades ago still holds well today 
john williams back course providing score film can 
 music pervasive throughout rousing dramatic ever always serving punctuate scenes noticeably appropriately 
since film supposed first installment nineepisode story star wars empire strikes back return jedi episodes four five six respectively phantom menace daunting task setting origins several characters know already addition unfamiliar 
 result attention history characterization spread little thin 
 nice get depth yoda obiwan example given fact several new characters cover understandable development left next two films 
one new characters darth maul hailed new villain much hype marketing forces muster prior films release 
 spite hype darth maul character almost didnt film role insignificant 
 maybe three spoken lines believe second actor voices character rest time just scowls looks mean 
 working never chance interesting instead ends utter disappointment 
lucas seems wanted develop spiritual nature star wars universe something prominent throughout 
however largely paralleling star wars spirituality bible offering easy storywriting bringing viewer back planet earth reallife connection 
oddly trying capitalize spirituality lucas time introduces fact mastery force dependent upon little forceloving parasites bodys cells 
 serves demystify workings force notches offering scientific connection 
dont let mislead far 
 phantom menace standards good film 
 contains lot visual treats sets stage epic story gives us bit excitement even allows us revisit old friends 
 just held predecessors unrealistic film simply pales
