warning actually wish see film stop reading see 
 dont blow plot details know movie disappointing built becomes waiting month see titanic thing 
 nutshell good film 
star wars episode phantom menace reviewed vince yim 
never biggest star wars fanatic world star trek next generation difficult relate mass fandom surrounding latest installment phantom menace 
however cant ignored 
endless toys lining shelves endless news reports multibillion dollar advertising campaign makes difficult 
 level hype one recall overhyped disaster godzilla definitely failed live expectations 
thankfully phantom menace much much better 
 first star wars trilogy told story jedi knight luke skywalker prequels backpedal tell backstory obi wan kenobi young jedi named anakin skywalker become father luke eventually become darth vader 
without blowing much story phantom menace evolves around peaceful planet naboo held hostage greedy trade federation two jedi knights quigon ji played liam neeson obiwan kenobi played ewan mcgreggor free 
 phantom menace taken literal beating various film critics leaving lower expectations somewhat 
common complaints range lack characterization weak narrative poor direction actors dated style much focus special effects 
still film critics often apply much historical theory regards film criticism much average film buff care 
hence film lot fun definitely improvement previous films even improvements special editions 
 many memorable sequences throughout film ranging fast furious pod race sequence take chariot races ben hur many fight scenes involving legions battle droids 
utilizing technology light years beyond anything made special effects computers used create everything monsters robots amazing cityscapes incredible detail 
 matter many times watch film will catch something new 
 level humour bit higher previous films well mostly conveyed reluctant hero jar jar binks belongs race known gungans 
best described mr bean planet naboo steals show 
unfortunately computergenerated character tells bit direction actors although natalie portman queen pretty effective jake lloyd young anakin skywalker 
 star wars mania time high risk film will disappoint doubts film tendency times 
 logic problems plot several things left unchecked times seems made diehard star wars fans although appearance tusken raiders makes laughs 
 young anakin skywalker really annoying character coming smarmy arrogant brat attitude wonder turns dark side 
still seems many people especially critics missing point 
 film fun half hours youll blow life something wouldnt mind 
 may psychological impact academy award contender really cares 
 film pure fun beginning end 
 isnt really matters
