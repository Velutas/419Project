although many people compared new gangster comedy hit hbo drama sopranos analyze witty entertaining enough good movie right 
billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol new patient happens gangster boss paul vitti de niro 
ben wants nothing vitti hes get married laura macnamara kudrow gangster patient wouldnt really help 
 ben soon drawn vitti worlds reluctantly helps vitti sort life 
 done comic fashion course 
although never brilliant analyze also never rubbish makes fun ride 
billy crystal hasnt good role since city slickers way back early s given role lets fully exploit wiseguy act 
hes pretty funny although character little close character city slickers hes pretty funny 
robert de niro hilarious vitti playing dead straight coming really funny 
hes serious gangster unaware comic gold mine 
lisa kudrow barely seen crystals estranged wife basically reprises phoebe role t v series friends getting rather tiresome doesnt come well screen 
 supporting cast apparently made entire cast casino goodfellas funny caricatures especially vittis bodyguard jelly joe viterelli 
 film genuinely plays like proper gangster movie laughs instead hard ass talking 
 sometimes gets little bloody light hearted film strangely fits 
spoofs made famous gangster movies including nice parody godfather 
 italian tunes playing throughout soundtrack contribute fun 
theres also odd plot points fbi guys appear suddenly disappear apparent reason 
 true analyze somewhat chequered production history perhaps plot points expanded earlier version script 
unfortunately hollywood will never know 
harold ramis best known egon ghostbusters deft touch directing comedy shown immortal groundhog day less immortal caddyshack 
 comic potential scene dug presented audience 
 script written ramis along peter tolan ken lonergan starts funny remains funny film sadly peters somewhat last twenty minutes wrongly enters serious territory 
 film short however just audience interest waning film suddenly goes rather rushed unsatisfying ending credits roll 
analyze good comedy certainly worth watching 
robert de niro sobbing reason enough watch even though seem forced like parody although think intentional 
crystal likeable years kudrow given little screen time possible good thing de niro just awesome 
 goodfellas probably wont remembered much groundhog day analyze well done comedy wont leave feel cheated
