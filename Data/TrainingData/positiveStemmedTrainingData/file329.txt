 film critics morals 
 unwritten laws ethical movie critic follow 
naturally dont want go film preconceived notions pretty tough something accomplish 
secondly along line cant prejudge film stars director etc difference 
well first one wed go film thinking going dumb going good affect viewing movie sounds looks dumb im expecting much 
 second hand simply assuming will bad good personal grudge film company made disney 
oh just merchandising ploy actors jim carreys 
 gonna stink director 
cant good 
 biased viewpoint opposed first impression viewpoint 
make sense 
ok comparing 
isnt kind along lines 
 compare certain actor director even composers credibility one film another involved really fair 
sure sequels can expect accept comparisons lot jackie brown example 
 fair take review turn comparison pulp fiction just quentin tarantino directed wrote screenplay 
 think ill tell 
 good critic able view film average joe jane viewpoint still taking account artistic integrity behind film 
sometimes can tough 
 acting superb bored loved 
 sooooo cheezy 
might used describe film 
 contradictions critic weigh sides come suitable balanced critique 
 important 
 better 
 extremely well shot acted film boring really amateurish film wanna go back 
getting back point philosophy comparing films fair works reflecting public wants know anyway 
every average person whos interested film likely ask compare pulp fiction 
 critic im already responsible ask question 
jackie brown stars pam grier blaxploitation heroine s likely make big comeback thanks role title character 
tarantinos pulp fiction big part responsible john travoltas sudden revival movie industry talks oscar nomination likely happen grier 
 weve made thru comparison jackie yearold airline stewardess brings extra cash probably main revenue smuggling large sums money united states ordell robbie pulp fictions samuel l jackson comparison 
ordell illegal firearms business enlisted aid louis gara robert de niro bank robber just got prison serving four years help accomplish scheme worth half million dollars 
trouble arises jackie stopped atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton taken custody possession narcotics well money allowed airport without claimed 
naturally proves obstacle ordells plans friendly intended wed hope posts jackies bail put behind bars 
 thing ordell one learn previous actions hes willing kill anyone stands way 
jackie finds tight squeeze 
ordell wont think twice taking fails help shes always done yet time compromise authorities order evidence ordell provided 
 comes simple question jackie rather face ordell prison 
 ensues rich intriguing example storytelling question jackie really help law ordell maybe just 
coming play another s veteran robert forster jackies bail bondsmen max cherry 
maxs obvious fondness jackie will become major benefactor fight beat sides system forster plays subtle charm adds depth unbrewed romance 
also involved ordells surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda ditzy sun bleached babe spends time watching tv bong hand 
fonda best can essentially thin role theres nothing therefore becomes tossable addition otherwise flourishing bouquet characters 
de niro also wasted role quiet nobody crook score bucks 
de niro brilliant actor character hardly ever speaks doesnt need de niro play 
compared pulp fiction comparison characters jackie brown thin replaceable 
 pulp fiction even small seemingly irrelevant characters wonderful complete lifelike whereas jackie brown common figures wouldnt suffered much lesser talented cast exception grier 
tarantino wrote script grier specifically mind say made role reversed truth 
sadly grier received bit attention especially story newlyjarred perception life 
jackson teams tarantino chemical reaction isnt awesome first time 
jules rambling biblequoting hitman pulp fiction jackson person pulled 
 although jackson really really good jackie brown dont think hes quite irreplaceable 
 fact maybe new face better 
jackson couldve remained tarantinos jules new guy become ordell forever remain memories 
sadly characters much except ordell just isnt impressive putting hands jackson going deter fond recollections jules 
another problem ordell way focused beginning 
 griers film spend long getting know man will become supporting character film progresses 
 makes movie feel little slanted makes slow beginning take longer getting meat story 
 likely pouring theater see film going anxious partake tarantinos quirky dialogue eccentric directing style much interested seeing silver screen adaption elmore leonards novel rum punch 
 moviegoers dont expect another pulp fiction youll satisfied script oozes familiar brash qualities made tarantino icon s film making 
 directing toned bit however yet still reminded tarantinos movie thanks odd splitscreen storytelling devices scenes replayed multiple times different viewpoints 
 getting back question began isnt pulp fiction 
 good isnt anything made pulp fiction revolutionary effort first place 
 conservative tarantino one wont satiate true fans 
 can realize isnt going knock socks youll happy least let massage feet 
 know much tarantino loves particular part human anatomy
