star wars episode phantom menace 
review matt pusateri 
 movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm affection like george lucas classic star wars 
 original blockbuster film two sequels evoked wonder passion generation filmgoers deeply entrenched american pop culture 
arguably americans today can explain force jedi budget deficit serb 
 years release original years since third film return jedi can new star wars film withstand weight incomparable expectations anticipation 
can new storyline new cast characters possibly compete legends first trilogy luke han solo darth vader cultural icons 
 challenge fourth star wars film episode one phantom menace hit screens last week 
 despite early critical reviews major media film neither flop disappointment 
 phantom menace certainly finest film series nonetheless engaging exciting visually breathtaking 
 worthy sequel er prequel original star wars films 
 phantom menace takes place decades setting original films 
 film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor wise old master introduced luke force original star wars young jedi apprentice still learning fellow jedi instructor quigon jinn liam neeson 
 republic government sent two jedi settle trade dispute developed blockade planet naboo shifty trade federation 
 jedi quickly find negotiations middle planetary invasion rushing protect naboos young queen amidala natalie portman 
later eventually rescuing amidala helping escape naboo forced stop tatooine repair battledamaged ship bringing galactic senate make appeal justice 
 tatooine quigon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd can help get parts need displays uncanny intelligence insight instincts 
quigon senses child unusually strong force begins suspect may one prophesized bring balance force 
 anyone watched original star wars trilogy knows far galactic savior innocentlooking yearold will time become ruthless darth vader 
complicating matters mysterious hooded figure darth sidious behind trade blockade invasion naboo sends lethal apprentice darth maul find capture queen amidala 
 amidala jedi fight save planet soon also deal deadly relentless darth maul 
 plot sounds bit complicated 
 phantom menace introduces earlier generation characters immediate crisis sets foundation events will eventually lead fall republic demise jedi knights anakins turn evil rise dark empire original trilogy 
 complexity overwhelming 
 story moves quickly drawback many questions predictably remain unanswered end film setting stage next episode 
one reasons films story seems hazy confusing unfocused 
 unclear whose story phantom menace 
 original trilogy movies clearly lukes story stories centering around growth farmboy rebel hero jedi knight 
 unclear whether new film anakins story obiwans 
 trilogy centered anakin shaky foundation 
lloyd like many child actors lacks subtle acting skills adult performers result character seems shallow unimpressive 
 screen see nothing suggests dark side lurking underneath littleboy face matter presence make seem special quigon willing believe one 
 rest cast fine though often work iffy dialogue lucas 
neeson perfect aging jedi knight 
mcgregor wellcast obiwan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility 
portman fits role young queen well lines often formal giving little room give character much personality 
 biggest problem phantom menace plot characters interaction 
individually characters new film less developed original star wars storyline confusing previous films series 
 unlike previous trilogy lucas doesnt good job playing characters one another 
 star wars immediate contrasts memorable exchanges luke han han obiwan leia luke 
 ensemble played immediately showed distinct attitudes personalities 
 sequence luke han chewbacca attempt rescue leia cell death star audience learns lot four characters ways react immediate problems 
 comparable sequence phantom menace flesh characters relationships 
individually interesting characters clear motivations interests lucas develops little chemistry tension 
 perhaps glaring weakness film probably reason disappointed many reviewers 
 despite need richer dialogue stronger character interaction film still engaging 
many wonderful elements lucas previous films make phantom menace memorable entertaining 
first course remarkably rich imaginative universe lucas creates 
 characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaursized sea monsters fight battle droids menacing destroyers venetianlooking planet naboo watch spectacular event part romanchariot race part nascar circuit arid desert planet tatooine head corsucant gothic urban capital republic home galactic senate jedi council 
 location elaborate complex 
lucas never settles vague ideas look settings creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces skylines 
 new special effects rereleased special edition trilogy changes allowed give earlier movies look feel just werent possible films made 
 ever new film lucas universe filled menagerie creatures robots personalities supporting cast aliens interact main characters 
 best character watto greedy tatooine junk dealer owns anakin mother slaves 
watto scratchy italian voice short paunchy body oddly mismatched wings flutter like hummingbird floats around room 
 computergenerated characters film watto best done enjoyable 
speaking computergenerated characters review phantom menace complete without mentioning controversial figure film jar jar binks 
 minutes screen time jar jar realization george lucas dream include fully computergenerated character cast new trilogy 
jar jar clumsy amphibian member gungan race literally stumbles way path jedi knights early film becomes qui jons accidental sidekick 
jar jar usually performs comicrelief role film lightening scenes mishaps inability stay trouble 
 animation jar jar nearly seamless interacts characters throughout film really set actors 
however despite technological magic makes character possible jar jar isnt completely convincing 
 still moves sounds much like cartoon blend scene 
throughout movie jar jar never transcends roger rabbit like presence 
 accept hes never lose sight fact animated character 
initially found jar jar annoying grew enjoy humor added film 
 second viewing film jar jar lot fun didnt mind 
 second reason film continues fine tradition star wars movies film replete humor small details flesh world lucas creates 
despite films struggles good evil sober musings ones destiny force like star wars films phantom menace never takes seriously 
fortunately lucas hasnt lost sight fact films entertainment high art 
 bumbling jar jar oneman twoheaded announcer team calling action films thrilling podrace sequence cameo appearance e t 
 film phantom menace simply lot fun lots halfhidden jokes humor can easily missed 
 finally phantom menace works films shortage speed action 
 beginning end lightsaber battles hairraising chases thrilling duels good evil 
 podrace sequence tatooine one entertaining exciting scenes star wars film final showdown obiwan quigon darth maul arguably best choreographed thrilling fight sequence lucas filmed 
 phantom menace wont win major oscars 
 probably wont beat titanics box office record 
 even best star wars film id put third original empire strikes back 
 exciting entertaining film far better typical summer blockbuster 
 film cant live hype film even original star wars done 
 still worth seeing 
probably
