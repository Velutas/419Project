david mamet long favorite screenwriter director 
 distinctive often ingenious dialogue laid back style direction nearly movies absolutely irresistible 
 tend thickly layered deceptive productions require audience look film less superficial manner plot seems require order discern concealed message sometimes even concealed storyline 
 although real plot new project winslow boy slightly conspicuous endeavors still brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture honor sacrifice difference commonly known justice right 
oh rated g 
incidentally first time mamet decided adapt someone elses work namely play terrence rattigan set th century 
 casts nigel hawthorne lead role arthur winslow rich aging man finds year old son ronnie kicked naval academy allegedly stealing shilling postal note 
 asks boy 
 father didnt ronnie answers 
thats enough arthur oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts crusade bring sons case court 
 enlist help sir robert morton notorious attorney help achieve formidably daunting task 
 seems fairly frivolous matter look winslow case trial century 
 arthur determined keep familys word clean willing go quite far make sure 
soon enough sir robert morton along rest country becomes equally wrapped proceedings 
 
 david mamet script tighten hone dialogue style still fairly apparent 
 characters still talk trademark staccatto lines still tension present conversations ordinary writer able make tense 
 mamets norm refreshing see mamet deviate world crooks gangsters con men wonderful films 
nigel hawthornes performance nearly flawless 
 delivery dignified yet pompous man seems getting beaten game 
 pity man also like 
rebecca pidgeon david mamets wife gave fairly awful performance spanish prisoner top game arthurs oldest daughter flailing feminist gives winslow case way making lack success womens suffrage movement 
 winslow boy wonderful movie avoids cliches seemingly inevitable courtroom scene shoots higher wants make real impact rather phony one 
 honest feel anything profound courtroom scenes films like time kill 
 wanted didnt movie 
 epitome subtlety powerful without emotional sad without even trying depressing 
david mamet can churn great scripts movie proves ever doubted hell director 
 almost national treasure 
 films deserve genre
