 grand scheme mel gibson movies payback better conspiracy theory good braveheart lethal weapon 
 words decent couple hours entertainment years now compile list mel gibsons greatest hits payback probably wont 
gibson plays crook gets double crossed partner heist payroll 
mels partner needed money pay mob debt 
 puts couple bullets mel leaving dead goes pay creditors 
 mel isnt dead real short movie certainly isnt happy 
 make matters worse wants money back willing go lengths accomplish feat 
 ex partner already used pay mobsters mel goes mob get back 
payback often violent film 
 credit scenes graphic director im sure one second made choice let audience use imagination instead subjecting us usual gratuitous gore found many films 
 film appears bit disjointed places understandable considering producer star gibson wasnt thrilled film turned wanted parts reshot 
 director refused another one brought reshoot 
 result final product apparently better original although personally love see original version comparisons sake get bit choppy feel towards end 
 always tough make film main character villain unless person redeeming qualities 
 case gibsons character redeeming qualities 
 hey mel even killing people cold blood still rooting 
 guess put johnny bananas actor role audience quite responsive 
gibson gibson whether playing suicidal cop stone cold killer good job 
 almost guarantees matter else happens rest movie least audience going get one good performance 
 time mel surrounded good supporting cast including maria bello love interest william devane kris kristofferson mod bosses 
 man steals show unfortunately doesnt real big part james coburn yet another mobster 
 one big disappointment film coburn didnt bigger role 
 end payback fairly solid action thriller just quite league mel gibsons work
