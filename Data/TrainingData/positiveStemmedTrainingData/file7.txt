apparently director tony kaye major battle new line regarding new film american history x dont know details fight seems happy final product nearly removed name credits altogether 
ive heard kind thing happening makes wonder much input studio films produce 
 found american history x extremely good film just tony kayes focused look touchy subject racism powerful charismatic performance edward norton 
 hard believe two years since nortons fantastic role primal fear now starring film making star 
norton one performers becomes character work american history x one best performances year 
 plays young man named derek vinyard skinhead living venice beach brother danny edward furlong mother beverly dangelo sister davin jennifer lien 
 film opens flashback derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing car 
 find lands prison film point seen eyes danny 
 presenttime film danny high school eager follow footsteps brother 
much film told flashback see path leads dereks adoption white supremacy 
 derek released served three years prison finds brother now fullblown skinhead derek however given violence tries get brother understand racism violence comes bad things 
 makes interesting two young men stupid thoughtless people intelligent articulate voice beliefs disturbingly straightforward terms 
 hard make controversial movie preach kaye found right note material 
 american history x mainstream film redemption phase main character people may think way make sympathetic 
 partially disagree although advocate racism way interesting way kaye presents derek loud obnoxious man hes also smart 
 reasons becomes skinhead believable father arbitrarily killed group black men 
 clear hes passionate beliefs hes just punk looking excuse beat people 
 course helps kaye actor talented norton play part 
 astonishing frightening norton looks shaved head swastika chest 
 addition getting look just right hes perfect role derek requires intelligence depth whole lot shouting norton ease 
even hes meanest derek likable quality thats gutsy approach telling story skinhead 
 adds depth story subplot principal dannys school avery brooks becomes obsessed purging hatred danny 
 performances terrific standouts furlong dangelo lien 
visually film powerful 
kaye indulges lot interesting artistic choices work nicely lots slowmotion strange camera angles add moody atmosphere 
 like lot movies lately american history x skims past greatness last minutes 
although climactic scene moving picture ends pretentious preachy resolution featuring brief narration character killed 
 movie smart subtle point felt like slap face handfed theme simplistic way 
 makes wonder exactly tony kaye disliked final version film 
perhaps last scene problem 
 hard imagine director least partially pleased film good time many movies timid weak american history x manages make compelling argument racism without advocating way
