 filmmaker deconstructs story well atom egoyan 
im referring specifically narrative form 
 sweet hereafter egoyan tells story similar framework exotica adjuster 
said story fatal school bus accident small town sam dent british columbia shatters morale locals told unstraightforward manner 
 film opens accident already happened stephens wonderful holm polite ambulancechaser arrived promise lawsuit will eek truth really occurred fateful morning 
throughout get meet parents dead broken souls follow stephens like pied piper passages read film 
 one living passenger paralyzed nicole polley whose dark secrets life accident may affect decision testify 
 finally see accident three quarters film stunning visual effect 
 horrific long take shows bus sliding stopping collapsing frozen lake best digital trickery movie year perhaps ever motion picture 
 fractured narrative also intercuts preoccupied stephens airplane traveling meet hivpositive runaway daughter well glimpses artificially happy lives people led preaccident 
 problem story story structure egoyans heavy handedness behind camera 
 first hour can quite honestly say verge tears miserable miserable people 
 thats just problem anguished folk sympathy wanes lot sadness becomes much 
also subplot involving incest rings untrue 
perhaps wouldnt feel contrived werent shot tasteful manner 
 two characters father daughter first appeared thought lovers 
 halfright 
nevertheless worthseeing 
 delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote american films action canadian films consequences hence recent wave films effects shock death toronto directors including crash kissed 
 sweet hereafter much better either two films simply boring case kissed afraid material necrophilia 
egoyan fine fine postmodern storyteller whose work entertaining edgy smart bit intellectual times 
though harped weightiness material always absorbed engrossed surprised sweet hereafter
