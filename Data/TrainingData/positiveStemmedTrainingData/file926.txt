contact film tries several different things 
 intended present realistic picture alien contact might like restore sense wonder mystery issue extraterrestrial life raise questions science faith relevant situation tell personal story romance astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey 
 film succeeds wonderfully first two goals 
 portrayal communication alien world much reasonable albeit less immediately engaging say coldblooded destructiveness invaders independence day even complex process abductions genetic hybridization forms ongoing plot line tvs xfiles 
 aliens contact seem like usthey curious anything else 
 know exist want us know exist like make next step communicate person 
 film wisely refrains showing us aliens directly characters ongoing speculation extraterrestrials outstanding visuals climactic yet enigmatic scene arroway arrives alien world sense wonder mystery comes force rarely seen since stanley kubricks space odyssey 
 film however takes place earth extended public debate respond aliens 
scientists enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders wary government officials caught somewhere 
 debate fueled largely dr arroways atheism seems obvious choice pilot spacecraft aliens provided blueprints many wary sending atheist humankinds representative another species 
 film partly successful raising exploring questions especially reaches conclusion suggests two approaches science faith viewed complementary rather diametrically opposed 
still film falls little short representation conflict exists american society 
 two sides represented primarily arroway farright fundamentalists reality probably americans neither atheists farright fundamentalists 
palmer joss occupies something middle ground ultimately becomes distracted personal motives comes across lessthanideal spokesman ideology 
 film concentrate mostly public debate tend dominated extremists rather dinnertable collegedormitory discussions 
contact accurate portrayal issues within narrow scope confines 
 films one clear failure portrayal romance arroway joss 
 one thing resorts tired movie clich two attractive people will immediately fall love soon appear screen together seem reason instant mutual attraction 
 romance rarely ever sheds light characters although occasionally tries fails josss explanation quit priesthood celibacy requirement guess say im man cloth without cloth example like punchline joke character development 
instead romance mostly seems exist sake later plot developments 
granted plot ideadriven film characters secondary just seemed like laziness writers part anything else 
 successes contact however far outweigh failures 
even social commentary fizzled altogether didnt simple yet mysterious story alien communication still made memorable film 
contact doesnt quite cover bases covers much one hope twohour film rejection bigbudget theatrics realistic story certainly admirable 
 surprised ten years now contact mentioned breath blade runner one finest examples sophisticated intellectually relevant science fiction
