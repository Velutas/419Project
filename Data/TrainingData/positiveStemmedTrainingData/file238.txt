 happy bastards second review 
big daddy 
happy gilmore father 
 course 
thats latest scenario presented adam sandler new movie big daddy movie thats passable isnt really considered sandlers best work 
 doesnt actually play happy gilmore movie variation 
hes sonny coufax man whos living settlement got cab running foot onedayaweek gig tollbooth man tollbooth willie 
 girlfriend kristy swanson fed lifestyle demands change leaves 
enter year old kid whos mysteriously dropped doorstep intended preppy roommate jon stewart whos china business trip 
 coufax basically acts kids father teaching different things like peeing side building tripping skateboarders sticks 
 even manages use kid sort con game get attention beautiful law office worker joey lauren adams somehow also garners attention social services arent particularly pleased coufaxs actions pretends roommate keep kid 
 reason say really sandlers best work gets really sappy towards end movie showing odd feelings somehow didnt really belong sandler vehicle 
 mean fits movies tone everything sandler handles well just oddly placed thats 
fortunately doesnt destroy goofy glee path following still makes feel good 
sandler good job movies 
rob schneider however irritating friend immigrant delivery boy cant read 
stewart minor time screen great adams remains joy watch 
look steve buscemi well homeless bum 
hes hoot 
directed dennis dugan director happy gilmore movie remains good couple hours pass time 
 faults hey everyone needs get emotional sometimes
