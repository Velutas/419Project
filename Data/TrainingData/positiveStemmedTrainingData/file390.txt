 left theater seeing david lynchs lost highway remarked fellow moviegoer feel like someone just sucked brains nose put back ears 
 first feature film five years lynch delivers film second debut picture eraserhead weirdness scale 
 wont know happened though certainly enough clues make reasonable guesses 
 difficult describe plot film depends partly interpret 
 can however describe see screen l jazz saxophonist fred madison bill pullman wife renee patricia arquette clearly suspects infidelity receive series videotapes apparently filmed inside house asleep 
 naturally enough little frightened confused doesnt help matters mystery man robert blake approaches fred party proceeds call telephone madisons house scene hilarious unnerving 
 next morning fred finds another videotape surprise shows brutally murdering renee bedroom 
 convicted murder sent death row inexplicably disappears one night replaced young mechanic named pete dayton balthazar getty 
 perplexed prison officials release dayton whose life begins intersect fred number ways notably affair alice wakefield arquette blonde otherwise renees spitting image another encounter mystery man 
 giving away little much reveal suffice say lynch doesnt offer neat wrap ups put lid metaphysical confusion cinematic demons lost highway full force beginning end 
 description might make lost highway sound like giddy exercise haywire surrealism fact traces lynchs weird sense humor film anything giddy time 
 contrary lost highway dark perplexing mystery takes lynchs previous excursions murder intrigue one step farther 
 film revolve around character investigating mystery rather character mystery 
 recurring times deeply disturbing images suspicion distrust infidelity thoughout film seem indicate deluded fractured psyche root bizarre goingson 
 audience left puzzle whose psyche driving probably freds opinion case characters events meant represent 
 proceeds appropriately lynchs typically slowpaced idiosyncratic style 
 often case lynch relies sound imagery mood dialogue action tell story lost highway works perfectly 
 scenes camera lingers freds blank expression drifts uncomfortably hallway pained face prison cell haunting strains mortal coils song siren can heard faintly background nothing technically happening scenes yet present vivid picture man losing grip just effective hysterical screaming found movie presentations insanity 
lynchs direction director photography pete demings darkly lit cinematography serve create nearly suffocating atmosphere tension fear exactly needed story 
well time anyway admit bit bored times section film pete dayton protgaonist less inherently interesting mostly keeps viewers attention tieins original mystery 
 main characters reality dayton wellmeaning none intelligent yearold sleazy gangster reason two names otherwise pretty much stock character pornstar girlfriend blond arquette nothing couldnt find two dozen pulp fiction wannabes fortunately reappearance mystery man well typically lynchian elements strained awkward conversations pete parents help preserve films spooky unnerving tone stretch 
lynchs typically graphic disturbing portrayals fringe sexuality relevant themes jealousy adultery also somewhat overdone 
 exactly exploitative like almost everything else film sex thoroughly weird creepy unlikely provide cheap lurid thrills much unnecessary frankly kind dumb seventh eighth time arquette takes clothes 
 said minor flaws dont prevent lost highway attaining place one darkest unsettling films hit screens recent years 
 oneway ride lost highway disturbed mind gripping intense brilliantly effective
