 tough really say something nice type person whos ethnocentric humanity now gone god american history x commend 
 takes balls intelligence make human neonazi skinhead kind person dedicates lives hating anyone whos film wisely miracurously pulls 
 subject film one worse one blind followers make skinhead members since leader pack 
hes one instigates take firm grip onto rage another brilliant stroke justifies political propoganda makes eerie sense speaks 
hes utterly convincing public speaker firm convictions comes shock actually goes rehabilitation process 
 name derek vinyard hes played edward norton much fire intensity speaks hes almost convincing arresting public speaker say malcom x first see hes clean shaven jet black swastica emrboidered left breast devlish goatee hes attacking black carjackers outside house dressed nothing white boxers carrying handgun hand never seems run bullets least doesnt need 
 believes convictions hes willing put beliefs test even knows will mean stop prison couple years 
 american history x derek became neonazi skinhead rose power rehabilitated prison murdering two black men fit rage less stealing car proving tried save others namely younger brother making mistake 
 see stages smart teenager vicious hate monger man epiphany man tries correct hes done get portrait man sides 
 least thats intention 
 films framing device brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking also now skinhead principal bob sweeney avery brooks just found captain star treks deep space trying correct 
 film opens danny just written book report mein kampf landing trouble sweeney causes make write paper dereks life gotten nowhere 
coincidentally day day derek released prison see hes cleanedup buff full head hair 
hes just intelligent still rough along edges hes wisened 
hes longer controlled anger blacks jews tries persuade danny whos becoming derek give lifestyle 
 danny wont 
 goes large skinhead beer bash meets skinhead leader stacy keach discovers derek opposed neonazidom couple years ago 
 film circles around spins nonlinear flashbacks done black white 
 mostly see derek prime skinhead living venice beach organizing vicious quasisadistic raids local stores longer hire white middleclass teenagers since can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants work mouthing theories affirmative action illegal immigrants blacks destroyed fundamentals country built 
 white man one gotten fuzzy end lolipop speaks elloquently forcefully intelligently backs everything political reasons justifying rage least 
 frighteningly enough much says sounds true 
 american history x collection really great scenes moments rather cohesive great film flows effortlessly one moment next 
 best scenes ive seen year 
one scene features dinner dereks family mothers newest boyfriend played reserve eliott gould jewish liberal quietly disagrees dereks rightist views launching scene fit rage anger builds unparalled emotions audience goulds reaction dereks final summation unnerrving 
another scene uses humor traditional macho sex talk build friendship nice connection derek black coworker guy torry folding laundry prison 
 another soontobeclassic actually divided two murder two black men winds derek jail contains final murder nasty may revoltingly shocking year 
theres much appreciate like acting uniformly good standouts coming avery brooks beverly dangelo longsuffering mother gould one horrible line comes best performance hes given seems like really long time 
norton walks film though coming intensity reduces anyone adequate job rubble 
 fifth movie career norton invented one reliable intense actors generation maybe best 
theres nothing like norton really gets rolling movie spewing lines authority commands attention audience coming power similar young maron brando 
 allows little emotions seep amazing 
sadly enough isnt going great portrait racism perhaps hopes 
 unambitious even little contrived really take either powerful statement emotional masterpiece 
 ending especially pencilled movies tossed just emotional keyboard can trounced upon 
 skinheads reduced mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail expressing desire eat even dramatic arc isnt well travelled 
furlongs danny never seems really learning lesson since flashbacks refuse show point view decides make change end inevitable doesnt seem like actually arrived 
even dereks descent skinheaddom doesnt seem justified 
though fireman father william russ dad boy meets world dont ask know killed black junkie even spoke affirmative action intelligently never seems real back story derek became intense beliefs 
 one can see director tony kaye wanted name removed 
sorta 
 american history x good movie moved lot better problem seems cut claims potential 
somewhere claims lies tony kaye cut true cut viewed norton ordered another cut thus 
although aimed directing credit go alan smithee resident name film disowned director wasnt allowed grounds disown film can badmouth really thats macguffin one really wanted film good given alan smithee sign disapproval 
kayes right par even hes referring normal par rather personal par 
 will right thing late s 
yet still gets point across intelligently backs story message one enwrapped ones beliefs pain suffering will occur literally said narration unfortunately 
 even isnt perfect least avery brooks turns norton beaten raped prison asks anything hes done made life better realy hits nerve derek also audience
