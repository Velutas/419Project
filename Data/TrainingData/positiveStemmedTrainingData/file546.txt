 dangerous beauty marshall herskovitzs sophomore directorial effort overlooked film jack bear 
partnered edward zwick herskovitz spent time producer television thirtysomething socalled life movies legends fall 
 directing style can best described transparent never gets way story yet discernible flourish particular distinctions 
 approached film number ways including overdosing sexual aspect wisely avoids 
 dangerous beauty contains just enough bare flesh ribald sex make appropriately erotic much seems exploitative 
herskovitz also aided strong supporting crew including luscious photography bojan bazelli whose previous efforts include highlystylized thriller kalifornia abel ferraras dark scifi film body snatchers 
bazelli captures film strong bold colors brings sixteenthcentury venice life wide panoramic shots often enhanced digital imagery 
however real details found production design norman garwood brazil princess bride costumes gabriella pescucci age innocence 
 problem dangerous beauty doesnt stick 
 good story welltold interesting characters easy shrug youve left theater 
 sequence chance truly indelible veronica pulled front hypocrisy inquisition threatened death penalty transgressions never quite comes simply melodramatic conventional 
herskovitz tries might make nailbiter somehow outcome foregone conclusion like rest film carries real weight despite potential severity subject matter
