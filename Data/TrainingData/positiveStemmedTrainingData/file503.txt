although postman knows hes running fraud concept renewed communications sets kids imagination afire especially ford lincoln mercury larenz tate secondincommand form new pony express dedicated getting mail 
 revived postal service doubles army fight holnists tyranny 
 postman become symbol hope rube goldberg manner 
although movie appeals sensibilities many things wrong can hardly counted 
 derivitive costners waterworld clint eastwood westerns 
theres little havent seen dozens times 
 film often downright corny 
 scene postman horseback grabs letter hands brighteyed child embarrassing slowmotion banality 
 films final minutes left cutting room floor 
despite films excessive three hour length several things never explained 
 war 
 civilization change rapidly 
everyone horses come 
 law eights bethlehem lives seems origins somewhere beyond film 
 believe rest world shape hasnt made way west help conquer 
 jumbled symbolism doesnt appear make sense 
 tale obviously saying communication can defeat evil much way internet potential topple governments beyond oddities 
 evil army called holnists sounds coincidentally like new age holism 
 another coincidence takes place just one year many ancient prophesies including ending mayan calendar predict new world mankind 
 general named bethlehem 
 seems reason 
sometimes movie feels like joke 
 army postal workers armed guns 
considering headlines recent years takes tremendous leap faith cheer guys 
 even difficult accept repowering federal government heroes 
given current climate country distrust big government asking lot audience get behind films nationalism 
even numerous flaws movie comes together weaknesses 
 doubtful postman going find much audience us going good time 
besides awaiting fall civilization caused year millennium computer bug 
 michael redman written column years like announce michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week accepting illicit package federal express best knowledge 
perhaps similarlynamed person used kevin costners postal service
