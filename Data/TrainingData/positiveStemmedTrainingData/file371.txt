 didnt realize apt name movie called mpaa motion picture association america folks decide whats g nc pg r x ask preview rated r can make sense response let tell movie 
 celluloid closet documentary homosexuality portrayed movies past several decades 
 brilliant funny naughty extremely poignant 
 tore heart watch gifted lesbian screenwriter explain rule gay audiences hunger hint homosexuality screen 
regardless veiled sordid presence gay lesbian person allows others lessen sense isolation makes feel theyre quite invisible america seems want 
 movie rated r good reason 
 contains scenes bloody violent gay bashing graphic uninhibited sex 
 movie appreciate knowing things ahead time can decide whether see movie friend date year old niece alone 
 thats movie 
now back preview 
prior film theatrically released originally filmed documentary hbo seen coming attractions trailer least six times 
 nudity violence bad language nothing see offensive inappropriate general audience okay whoopi goldberg refer someone boning someone last knew wasnt one seven words cant say tv 
except scene two fully clothed men kissing 
hmmmmm 
 inquired rating trailer nice woman mpaa quoted handbook trailer approved audiences contain homosexuality lesbianism going someone 
hello office middle day 
bravely pursued 
 ive seen trailer oh 
probably half dozen times gulped 
 dont remember scene 
 well chirped 
 
 little eyes trained see 
 really 
 words dave barry making 
 trained see 
 someone shocked rating first time made note watch carefully following five times managed let slip past 
gosh certainly dont mean question mpaa handbook 
 however like suggest closet one 
 light aint good 
 seen celluloid closet one handful straight people involved primarily gay lesbian weekly bible study email ill give details none big surprise 
 point movie homosexuality even politically correct s ridiculously perceived threat mostly heterosexual society 
 point well made candid honest film 
now go mpaas ruling trailer must contain homosexuality lesbianism ask defined particularly light things sexual nonsexual ive watched straight people trailers 
 just dont feel need go seems obvious 
ill instead suggest mpaa reevaluated evaluation criteria 
let ratings reflect subject content like sex violence 
let reflect attitude content 
 future id interested knowing whether movie rated d disrespectful s stereotyped 
 id truly able make informed decision spent time
