though fine piece filmmaking theres something elizabeth 
left bit cold think something bugs quite often films particularly days just didnt care characters 
 first foremost job filmmaker create characters imagined historical case may audience gives hoot 
 though elizabeth works well many levels falls short excellence reason 
elizabeth takes place england queen mary half sister elizabeth monarch side catholicism dying 
 dies though bear sign document condemn half sister death heretical protestant beliefs 
 result amidst much anger within council elizabeth becomes queen england 
 film chronicles rise power fights unified church england tries bring order personal political life 
much film deals elizabeths love lord robert mysterious man thrusts lordship onto many woman continues proclaim love queen 
 much ado lack husband political pressures spain france enter equation 
 problem film lies centerpiece love interests character driven element 
 didnt much care characters perhaps aside elizabeth played quite well blanchett didnt much interest join nuptials 
 cast rounded well marvelous rush plays queens loyal advisor sir francis attenborough wellmeaning oldfashioned lead council 
 must asking recommend elizabeth 
simply result perfect pairing director cinematographer 
kapur cinematographer remi adefarasin neither heard create beautifully realized piece filmmkaing technical side 
 light streams frame painting period beautifully captures realistic light sources found churches cellars castles th century europe 
 frame rich color contrasted blackness blownout white light windows 
 costumes alexandra byrne deserve mention inportant aspect shot 
indeed elizabeth one visually beautiful films decade ranking kundun braveheart 
watch also incredibly godfatheresque mass murder scene
