one best things movies can make really start wonder analyze things everyday life might thought much otherwise 
 films might just secondary issue dark city get nearly entire film committed philosophizing theorizing human memory defines poignant theme made absolutely beautifullyconstructed film kind story setting happen movie 
theres old roleplaying computer game called d ja v wherein player takes role man cant remember got 
 goal gather many clues possible figure along way overcome conflict 
 premise film unlike game time dont control protagonist 
 begin meeting seemingly ordinary man living extremely dark dirty city actually just city whole reality isnt just neogothic look la batman blade runner fully developed almost different genre completely 
later will learn name john murdoch sewell now idea whats going fact something right 
 fact theres dead body corner goes enhance feeling paranoia mysterious hurried call telling leave immediately also chilling 
 opening scene alone goes long way define setting film bizarre horrific tone 
 man doesnt know hes going interesting follow since viewers idea either can sympathize identify 
 fact way stories begin since impossible know history character feelings values morals etc weve observed 
 case total feeling amnesia excellent tool towards characterization developing mood outlining story 
eventually semblance plot begins unfold appears john serial killer wanted police 
 met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional softspoken deadpan man appears trail killer time 
two important characters also introduced dr daniel p schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist claims johns doctor emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled look like caraciture right old dick tracy serials given leading lady old filmnoir movies 
 schreber contacted john reasons continually revealed throughout course film 
 also contacts emma helps film reveal seemingly complex mysterious back story 
 absolutely nothing appears dark city makes fascinating throughout continual scenes confusion vertigo 
everything filmmakers want us see significance considering intricate detail every single shot lighting art direction overall production design dont seem able afford gratuities 
however might also whats keeping reaching maximum potential 
 continuing follow john wanders around strange place much unlike real world know come realize hoax 
everyone city subject experiment conducted race aliens understand makes humans tick efforts somehow save extinction 
 films tagline says last night one us went 
 reasons never clearly explained appears john possesses telekinetic powers can pretty much whatever mind can conceive process known tuning 
 aliens look like old bald human men pasty skin also possess power en masse use change city every night midnight 
 time humans fall asleep changes made awake either continue left begin new life idea 
 premise certainly interesting director coscreenwriter alex proyas able keep film consistently mysterious regard 
 provide explanations dr schreber assistant strangers somehow synthesize memory chemical form 
 aliens mix match memories citys population see will change will 
 process creates good deal deep thoughtprovoking philosophies applied real world 
however film errs playing idea memory versus human heart makes person 
 main characters closely intertwined within seemingly complex murder mystery never actually happened yet start go expected emotions comes distant static cold mediocre performances hurt connelly dont help either 
 example john realizes emma probably never wife feel emotional bond yet scenes crucial films plot expected believe genuine love also part films climax ending 
 thats proyas seems inferring film never quite manages convey fullest sense 
ironically made first film crow work well similar theme struggling find hope human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world 
 dark city messenger seems mistaken message 
still film means bad consistently entertaining enjoyable 
theres lot like notably sheer visual look style accounts least half reasons film able tell story 
 story whole one original come hollywood years 
dark city movies escape real world
