according hollywood movies made last decades life small town one worst things happen human 
even worse fate awaits unfortunate grow dark godforsaken places later forced live forever traumatised experience 
 hand seems something atlantic ocean divides europe america one popular beloved european films takes exactly opposite view 
 film amarcord comedy famous italian director federico fellini later gave inspiration numerous imitations homages even led american screen artists adopt heretical views benefits small town life 
 film based screenplay fellini tonino guerra lacks plot usual sense 
instead follow one year s italian summer resort town rimini series short vignettes depict various local events customs well series local often colourful characters 
although many characters occasionally take role narrator movie concentrates nominal protagonist year old boy titta played bruno zanin chronicles sexual frustrations obsession local beauty queen named gradisca played magali noel problems lovingly dysfunctional family well troubles father played armando brancia mussolinis fascist regime 
amarcord often noted ultimate nostalgia film probably explains popular even among people actually dont like federico fellinis work much 
every member potential audience find part film fellini film clearly illustrates natural human desire paint past best way possible 
distortion actual past subjective interpretation found even title film word amarcord nothing badly pronounced phrase remember local italian dialect 
 way word distorted past memories remember 
 premiere fellini rejected claims autobiographical character film doesnt matter whether rimini amarcord actually resembles rimini fellinis childhood place time resemble characters situations film 
fellinis views nostalgia clearly illustrated way mixes reality fantasy film 
even naturalistic scenes laced dark humour grotesque images 
characters look like caricatures actors playing often deliberately overact women especially fuel tittas sexual fantasies often certain body parts gargantuan proportions 
every now scenes depict s reality gradually slide fantasies movies characters rimini becomes almost indistinguishable magical place characters visions 
 almost everything film looks different cases better looked real life 
even fascism gets fellinian makeover fellini views mussolinis totalitarian regime nothing visual spectacle explaining similar regimes enjoyed popular support throughout history opportunity comedy 
 fascists finally show true colours begin torturing opponents even becomes opportunity scenes macabre humour 
unlike many italian colleagues s used s period setting explicitly condemn fascism serve fashionable political agenda fellini doesnt care much politics 
lack selfrighteous moral perspective compensated fellinis humanistic approach characters 
 regardless age gender social class physical appearance given opportunity express views dreams fears 
fellini treats characters warmth affection even paints grotesque caricatures real people 
 warmth democratic spirit amarcord viewed one humane films th century keeps general feel good atmosphere despite depicting many uncomfortable melancholic even tragic moments 
fellini couldnt produce effects without using directorial talent gave personal touch movie 
vignettes arent memorable characters fellini uses camera painting film bright colours especially scenes depict characters fantasies 
fellini also knows use locations whether location happens luxurious hotel brightcoloured beach rural countryside 
even downtoearth streets rimini everyone knows everyone gets magical dimension snowfall 
 hand lack credible special effects somewhat diminished effect ocean liner scene 
 atmosphere also provided incredible talent composer fellinis longtime associate nino rota 
 amarcord theme probably one recognisable popular relaxing uplifting pieces film music ever produced 
 music alone reason view amarcord one indisputable classics seventh art
