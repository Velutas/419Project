ill first admit 
 mention book great expectations immediately begin experiencing flashbacks junior high english class confronted torturously boring book filled people nonsensical names pip magwitch 
yes classic literature rather dry one shoved young throat like spoonful bitter medicine 
certainly experience wasnt truly bad quote ethan hawke latest movie adaptation said book im going tell story way happened ill 
gonna tell way remember 
anyway return nostalgia lane get back present hollywood trendy attempt modernize classics now presents updated film version great expectations 
instead pip time central character named finn played boy jeremy kissner ethan hawke adult 
finn orphan raised unfaithful sister maggie mrs joe kim dickens boorish fisherman husband joe chris cooper 
 setting florida coast mids 
finn blooming artist spends time running around beach drawing fish one two favorite subjects 
 one escapades literally stumbles upon escaped criminal robert deniro 
borrowing page superhuman max cady deniros criminal seemingly limitless lung capacity favors hiding ocean floor 
ok maybe 
thats exaggeration certainly beats houdinis records opening scenes film 
 thats nothing next fuel efficiency finns motorboat digress 
anyway finn convict good deed just show hes really swell guy 
 plot moves 
enter miss havisham 
ms dinsmoor anne bancroft 
abandoned altar years ago ms dinsmoor epitome crazy rich old maid 
 bizarre clothing eccentric mannerisms pounds makeup anne bancroft seriously overacts role 
although ends nowhere near believable character add humor film 
joe hired help gardening unkempt manner insane ms dinsmoor soon hires finn plaything niece estella raquel beaudene young girl gwyneth paltrow adult 
 apparent reason provide main plot film finn instantly stricken estella 
perhaps snooty attitude utter disdain person maybe finn simply never met girl 
 case neither children adults chemistry simply doesnt exist two yet finn spends remainder film pining 
even adult finn arrives new york behest mysterious benefactor reacquaints estella draws portrait nude theres nothing 
 fact sexual tension helen hunt greg kinnears gay artist similar scene good gets 
 point audience grown cold detached estellas character couldnt care less two characters 
 bulk blame falls upon gwyneth paltrow 
 fails imbue estella remote character book even vaguest traces humanity 
theres obviously something wrong watching film youre interested big nose looks silhouette character 
without strong estella finns obsession seems baseless 
 wish just stop whining let estella marry rival walter plane oddly subdued hank azaria just get life 
 fact two relationships work film purely tangential main plot 
finns relationship brotherinlaw joe interesting bit stereotypical 
whats fascinating interactions deniro 
although bit part goes show much vitality strong actor can create 
 apparent director alfonso cuarsn put lot work creating imagery film 
 shots work others obviously staged example water fountain scenes impact 
finns art actually creations italian painter francesco clemente used throughout film mostly fails intended effect 
 never see finn generate style art simultaneously crude insightful 
 result ends distant rest film 
modernizing classics currently vogue just see william shakespeares romeojuliet 
simply update action modern setting apply plenty modern rock 
 adornments little perk great expectations 
 much dreaded novel first read youd probably better suffering though reading watching romanceless film
