synopsis sullen julie james still haunted nightmares killer ben willis know last summer perks new best friend karla wilson wins trip four bahamas 
arriving start hurricane season julie karla run around tight clothing realize theyve walked trap set rainslickered slasher huge hook hand 
comments may showing pop culture illiteracy never seen episode fox tv series party five 
 vaguely aware shows premise knowledge comes brief commercials halfpaid attention watching tube 
 party five know however seems starting ground actresses teen horror genre 
neve campbell scream queen s star scream scream craft regular show 
 jennifer love hewitt 
lo behold following footsteps campbell hewitt now horror franchise know last summer line 
though original film released last year watchable enough insipid sequel looking theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout 
jennifer love hewitt goodlooking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles acting 
 just isnt convincing film wasnt original either 
 puts many young males including paradoxical quandary shes attractive annoying spoiled valley girltype character tries play annoying extreme ruins many scenes emphasize exploitatively figure 
add mix equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star get one frustrated male audience 
ive spent much time hewitt brandy reason 
 still know last summer though cashing success original ultimately serves vehicle two young actresses 
nothing else original interesting 
 movie fact makes recent soso horror films like urban legend john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works high art 
 still know relies heavily tired slasher film cliches isolated location storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots bluelighted darkness scenes garbed slasher walks around background without characters seeing knives sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc get picture 
 entire audience knows secondary characters introduced film going receive business end killers hook 
 may well huge targets painted 
like scream numerous knockoffs secondary characters supposed serve comic relief 
unfortunately still knows characters arent funny 
 particular one character chainweedsmoking guy obnoxiously annoying certainly doesnt die soon enough 
 death scenes way relatively violent theatrically released horror film 
several uncomfortable watch reminded sickening gore scenes hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie 
 help supposed humor still know shooting 
 deal slasher 
 know slasher film particularly intelligent genre ben willis got go one silly slashers mainstream horror 
come guy looks like gortons fisherman gruff voice makes sound like disney pirate 
though lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter theater appearance borders absurd horror film thats really saying something 
 thats left talk jennifer love hewitt brandy 
 prance tightfitting revealing outfits various states undress yet neither ever actually nude scene 
hewitt however postshower scene thin bathrobe quite 
 
 titillating 
 scene alone made onestar turkey earn two stars rating system 
otherwise hewitt brandy grate nerves 
early film instance brandy wins trip bahamas 
 hewitt jump around scream screech seems like forever 
 needed extrastrength tylenol part 
oh films conclusion talk repetitive 
people saw know last summer will predict still knows ending least minutes happens 
boring 
 saw movie brother local downtown movie theater 
admission one dollar wednesdays often go see bad movies days just ridicule 
 usually fun thing along rest audience dont seem mind participating mass mystery science theater type viewing 
 still know last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences audience underscoring bad really 
 werent main actresses revealing wardrobes id hard time sitting lame sequel 
 cant imagine trying watch video horror films seem times better theater rely heavily audience participation wouldnt recommend people unless theyre horror film fanatics huge fans hewitt brandy 
 read website somewhere another sequel already works 
 depressing thought 
hewitt apparently needs spend time tv figuring act 
rated r film contains lots violence several gory scenes couple nubile horny teenagersthough sex act always thwarted 
id say unsuitable kids teens wouldnt problem sitting especially since obviously compose films target audience
