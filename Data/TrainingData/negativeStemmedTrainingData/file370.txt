renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed jeanclaude van damme action stars pairing dennis rodman doubleteam managed make initially appeared disaster slick stylish somewhat diverting action timekiller 
tsui continues energetically pile visual razzle dazzle latest collaboration muscles brussels knockoff time around style neither save script best ridiculous worst incomprehensible hide host truly lousy performances 
writer steven e desouzas fairly straightforward plotline isnt outre doubleteams strange yarn involving secret think tankprison makes much sense little 
van damme plays marcus ray hong kongbased sales rep jeans company stumbles upon russian terrorist scheme implant powerful microchipsized bombs hk product exports u s dolls electronic equipment yes jeans 
 part type ransom scheme remember isand kid notgraphics cia computer screen showing map world bombs detonating hatwearing figure side world bursting laughter 
 crowd showing attended spontaneously throughout knockoff 
 van dammes films share unintentional laughs mostly due stiff acting skills physically agile van damme knockoff delivers usual though many van dammes embarrassing directorial effort s thequest 
 lot laughs earned particularly painful lines desouza smoked badass like roman candle 
 entrepreneurship babycakes 
standing among favorites 
 indeed pathetic performances provide bulk knockoffs laughs 
van damme true laughable form perhaps even worse usual 
early scenes actually require make funny costar rob schneider improbably cast deep cover cia agent posing marcuss business partner sight sound stillheavilyaccented van damme haplessly trying drop punchlines hilarious wrong way 
even typically good actors immune bad acting bug 
paul sorvino unconvincing terribly overwrought schneiders cia superior lela rochon playing investigator jeans company spends entire movie perpetual snarl mode 
 rochons defense though role requires little display toned legs exquisite bone structure perky bosoms latter coming handy one key scene must fish microbombs stuck ample cleavage 
tsui picks left visually doubleteam juicing proceedings inventive camera work 
 though tsuis visual razzle dazzle borders kill coming desperate attempts shield inanity entire enterprise 
 nifty trick tsui pulls recurring visual theme camera literally going circuitry electronic devices others completely superfluous 
 especially disconcerting trick question clever used right context 
 instance one scene early marcus putting hand box 
 puts hand action shown overhead camera angle rectangle corner screen 
 undoubtedly interesting visual nice use actually amounted something 
 test van damme movie boils action sequences surprisingly knockoff leave much desired 
tsui can make something employing freeze frames blurred motion unconventional camera angles nothing fundamentally special fairly generic chase fight sequences written desouza 
 isnt anything preposterously amusing climactic tigerland mine fight doubleteam let alone anything remotely close tsuis legendary hong kong works thats given going 
 tsui hope approaching countryman john woos stateside success best break free van damme 
 late 
 continues involvement bgrade movies knockoff respect hk action fans will continue diminish 
 hasnt already disappeared entirely fiasco
