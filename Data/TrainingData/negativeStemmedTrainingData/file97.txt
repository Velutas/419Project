much ado nothing 
ah sweet irony 
 accepted wisdom circles among english literature nuts mainly whenever critic knocks shakespeare ignorance 
 just doesnt understand shakespeare will hear say 
 bards work apparently beyond criticism 
 load old cobblers 
 arbiters public taste think kenneth branaughs film shakespeares comedy much ado nothing comedy modern sense word time get life 
get monty python 
get woody allen 
get john waters 
whatever 
just get real taste clever witty risky comedy 
 banish nonsense belongs 
drama tragedy shakespeares strength 
 sensibilities im stick mud much ado nothing resonates spark whatsoever 
 kidding film ranks among embarrassing two hours ever spent cinema years movie going 
 thing stopped walking loyalty lady friend day hadnt seen ages 
 boy owe one 
 wont spend much time plot 
basically follow trials tribulations two wouldbe couples one young older 
theres dark treachery amongst everyone awfully jolly youd hardly know 
mind theres nothing wrong basic story 
good romantic comedies based similar premises abound 
nothing wrong cast either 
branaugh emma thompson denzel washington talented performers 
 problem script accurately shakespeares original text 
light comedy shouldnt complex 
yet wrapped elizabethan english dialogue becomes difficult comprehend 
 alone will problem modern audiences unschooled shakespeare search nothing good undemanding laugh 
 laughs escape belly brought gloriously inept performance keanu reeves actor miscast jealous halfbrother something 
 dissected understood boils stuff just goddamn lame 
 comedy clean nice corny devoid danger leaves viewer totally cold 
ho ho ho boy likes girl 
ho ho ho men klutzes 
ho ho ho shes awfully clumsy 
oh please 
theres wit somewhere im told 
 call pretentious 
something lightweight striving something sophisticated clever wordplay 
 end cringeworthy 
watching cinema patrons around collapse laughter made much ado nothing weird movie going experience 
comedy 
bah humbug
