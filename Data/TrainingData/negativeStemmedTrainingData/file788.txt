 friend film school just made two minutelong film one classes includes staged anal rape scene done two guys shot shadow incident banana used instrument penetration 
 sick watching one admittingly hysterical moments ive ever witnessed 
sure may bad taste hell bad taste something may offensive riotously amusing rest 
 theres caligula 
 film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio sexes elaborate lengthy orgies greasedup fist forced mans rear wine poured man whos urinary tracts tied penis chopped fed hungry dogs etc etc etc well respectable film following occurred events graphically shot clear view b tone trying shock comically well show historical accuracy c film million dollar production lavish sets rather impressive cast whopping hour running time 
produced funded none bob guccione owner penthouse magazine caligula comes across hysterical dramatic picture since plan outer space underneath theres sense everything film accurate justified also brilliantly entertaining 
 really fact film features aforementioned disgusting moments actually believes dramatic weaponry 
 film discarded content film never old cliche goes 
 bash film content glancing biggest obvious problem caligula thats nothing overdramaticized bullshit start finish without second credibility mammoth running time 
 caligula allegedly tells true story evil roman emporer name man insanely decadent assasination came blessing 
 guess even though almost every single roman emporer assasinated well much reasons 
 film opens wrong note course quote mark appearing image graces screen using overused passage shall profit man gain whole world dlose soul depite fact opening scene film emporer emporer fucking around sister field suppose one lose soul one soul first place 
 plot incomprehensibly done anyone else can make caligula disastrously played great malcom mcdowell performance opposite performance clockwork orange next line throne cant wait current emporer tiberius peter o toole ditto performance lawrence arabia grandfather die kills ascends throne 
 abuses position marries woman helen mirren retains dignity actor exactly acting doesnt just sleep sister dreadful teresa ann savoy pretty naked willing hop sack mac anyone asks hop abuses position little little little believe invades england killed 
 filler instead recounting life supposed guccione claims ultimate portrait decadent pagan rome complete orgies vicious deaths lots nudity 
 instead historical accurate film really really wants instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image like 
oh isnt great just loved sex 
 killed people disgustingly 
 wouldnt great make couple bucks selling shit accuracy even though blatantly real bad porn ive completely convinced 
 mean just show roman orgy can spend good ten minutes examining every single facet makes 
 just disgusting vile whatever adjective want use describe film film entire feel going isnt felt also sloppiest expensive movie time 
 sets lavish blatantly innacurate wonder historian wanting name film explains 
 doesnt matter since cinematography dark wonder light meter used making dark ugly just plain dark 
 camera operation also worst ive ever seen entire life 
 film hold record unnecessary zooms one single shot ever often camera will lose subjects pan around till find focus 
 editing sloppy scenes absolutely impossible follow 
 writer speak hell mean adapted original screenplay gore vidal nevertheless dialogue shit laughably bad cant good faith believe anyone iq say straight face favorite line caligula inquires doctor health dying tiberius go moment care last year 
 music film mostly prokofiev khachaturian use gorgeous adagio spartacus phrygia ad nauseum used attempt give film emotion instead feels shipped elsewhere 
 orgy scenes one infamous lesbo scene penthouse pets lori wagner aneeka dilorenzo result reshoots guccione obviously removed everything else film adds embrassment every five seconds film cuts random nudity afraid audience forget film rated x 
john gielgud represents voice sanity walking around brief role constantly mantra im going kill agent im going kill agent 
 hours making caligula exciting enriching three hour college lecture class twice deliriously annoying 
guccione pursuit historical accuracy instead made film painstaking arduous task watch entirety doubt anyone can sit hour without irreversible psychological damage 
throughout entire film presence guccione easily felt standing edge screen pretentiously looking upon us saying look can get away 
 dont like youre prig worse know nothing history 
uh huh 
theres clear difference historical accuracy something thats artistically good 
 film showed roman decadence something perhaps liberating last probably make good film 
 using historical accuracy licence get away kind disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts total total bullshit can say guccione makers film lost kind touch either entertainment eroticism developed pathetic sadistic taste judging film 
theres film came called cook thief wife lover magnifcent film legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren deals graphic sex heartstopping violence gore even little cannibalism good measure 
 film never patronized viewers also handled way shocking yes also bizarre way entertaining totally involving 
 real characters real situation best passion just right amount restraint get fact going offensive many 
 film achieved everything wanted since retained status one cult films popular actualy good 
 everything caligula might alas wasnt
