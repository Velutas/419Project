 love movies 
 really 
every time watch great movies like goodfellas raiders lost ark tear comes eye due awesome talent skill entertainment display 
even lower grade films naked gun ghostbusters ii exactly brilliantly well made certainly waste celluloid present entertainment value 
 theres favourite martian exact opposite movie hurried poorly written acted movie one goal make money 
disney ever since lion king lost magic touch dross just shows far disney sunk 
christopher lloyd plays martian crash lands front t v reporters tim ohara car daniels soon tim finds martian home trying recover fix spaceship 
along zoot spacesuit voiced wayne knight must fix spaceship explodes also try stop identity revealed public firstly ohara later rival t v presenter brace channing hurley calling tims uncle martin 
laughter supposed arise comical events never 
many bad films good intentions favourite martian doesnt appear try provide entertainment 
filled brim wham bang special effects favourite martian offers little nice eye candy 
christopher lloyd mugs way entire movie ive never seen man pull face minutes now 
jeff daniels plays staple nice guy role useless 
 performance incredibly lazy although paperthin character doesnt deserve performance gives 
darryl hannah looks pretty ever role somewhat erm limited 
hurley mistakes acting shouting looking like twit wins david wilcock award irritating godawful performance moving picture 
way go liz 
 supporting cast disney manage assemble every character actor film going guy ah er 
 finally giving switching 
another major setback staple comedy sidekick 
unfortunately writers sherri stoner deanna oliver anyone cares forget comedy sidekick needs funny 
instead deliver zoot martians deeply unfunny sidekick 
although meant manic character doubt every line comes neck dud 
 real dud 
citizen kane delivers laughs minute hell spawn piece polyester 
even kids audience insulted character one child even bothered smirk 
 nice special effect though 
another problems comedy gags 
 rather lack 
 favourite martian reaches new level toilet humour goes past bowl pipe sewer 
now toilet humour can funny dumb dumber humorously showed 
 characters farting belching almost getting crapped literally amusing 
 insulting 
theres one good gag right credits appears guy wrote gag tragically died unfunny twin continued 
either hoping easy please six year olds wouldnt mind fact movie beaten men work funny stakes 
yes men work 
yowza 
 fact lot money pumped film actually got people agree film just depresses even 
 thousands brilliant films cant get distribution yet trash like gets released nationwide ease 
thankfully soon makes money will never seen favourite martian will end two lead characters near end movie toilet
