comments todd mcfarlane left marvel comics made name firstrate comic book penciller spiderman titles join newlyformed creatorowned image comics new comic book legend born spawn 
mcfarlanes spawn immediately became commercial critical success defining comic book series s 
mcfarlane created hero original visually intricate allowing mcfarlane utilize knack artistic detail max 
 early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlanes genius illustration show early attempts writing 
 popularity spawn success current warner bros s batman film franchise movie version sort seemed inevitable spawn 
 summer hence new line cinema released spawn liveaction film based groundbreaking series 
 topheavy exercise violence special effects unfortunately topples quickly leaves fans comic book like numbed much spawn misses mark 
 happened 
 spawn bad 
todd mcfarlane executive produced disappointing misfire even appears cameo 
 dont think however presence necessarily hurt helped film 
 place blame part recent hollywood trend fueled public demand apparently special effects blowout movies utilizing latest computer technology 
 films focus upon effects expense everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting trend shows audience one gratuitous scene another populated morphing characters filled unnecessary pyrotechnics 
hardly minute goes film without fires explosions knives chains appearing nowhere glowing eyes constantly transforming demons 
 lot visually interesting technically solid dont get wrong script cast arent engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper surface may capture eye nothing exists underneath 
spawns translation comic book suffers storyline level 
mcfarlanes spawn tortured hero 
 mercenary trade al simmons nonetheless warm man love beautiful wanda 
 died journeyed hell made pact return earth wanda 
simmons however discovers memories fragmented body creepy mess wife married 
despite sometimes violent nature readers couldnt help feel sympathetic toward plight spawn underworld 
spawn attempts show spend nearly time 
 characters developed seem absurd rather touching 
 cartoonish dialogue implausible subplot general possesses antidote supervirus called heat wishes unleash enslave world help matters 
spawn apparent attempt duplicate success batman also unwisely spends much time villain violator batman favored joker batman 
john leguizamo like jack nicholson batman receives top billing cast violator michael jai white al simmons spawn second 
 ordinarily find leguizamo intensely annoying presence films seems make perfect candidate violator 
 film however spends much time violators offensive antics grate nerves 
apparently meant comic relief film nicholson batman especially contrasted sullen spawn violators lines oftentimes grotesque unfunny leaving audience wishing leave 
leguizamo satisfactory job role seen far often film 
michael jai white relative newcomer theatrical releases seems appealing actor handles role adequately see little without various masks 
 time needed spent whites character became spawn movie pull heartstrings 
 special note made martin sheen overthetop obnoxious evil general wynn 
easily hammiest performance movie hard imagine sheen mucked role much played vietnam assasin brilliantly great apocalypse now 
sheens excessive demeanor help audience accept mastermind villain comes surprise considering extensive career film 
many elements conspire disappointing script abundant special effects drag spawn 
mtvstyle jerky inyourface editing one 
flames example roll across screen sometimes announce shift setting 
cogliostro unlikely wannabe guide spawn serves poor narrator film 
 goofily tells audience one point much spawns humanity left remains seen audience really cares one violent sequence leads another 
 music finally assaults audience much manic violence offensive dialogue 
loud obnoxious hard rock fused drum loops dominate scenes 
 fair however marilyn mansons long hard road hell effectively compliments spawns return earth filter crystal methods cant trip like proves surprisingly fitting theme song 
 good comic book spawn spawn good movie 
spawn instead suffers much pomp circumstance little plot character development 
 receives two stars technically welldone special effects 
many films though equal superior special effects much better 
rated pg spawn seems violent many rrated movies probably wouldnt appropriate young
