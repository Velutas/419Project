ive got admit 
im huge jim carrey fan 
 loved first ace ventura well mask dumb dumberand even batman forever pretty awful movie carrey one people come looking reasonably good 
 saw ace ventura idea people find guy annoying 
sadly ace ventura shows just irritating annoying carrey can 
carrey goes schtick went first ace movie time longer funnyit just rehash many jokes used ace 
 plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring failing save raccoon reasonable cliffhanger spoof 
soon called retirement find bat kidnapped returned four days will cause two warring african tribes destroy 
 ace save day using uncanny detective skills 
 disappointed carreys restrained roles films following first ace ventura may glad see overacting best ability may disappointed fact sequel doesnt capture feel original 
 original benefited looked carreys constant hypedup improv sequences hysterically funny 
 however tighter script reminiscent old disney telemovies takes improvised material first shamelessly recycles new movie giving carrey little chance improvise 
instead extremely funny manner reduced just walking around stupidly 
 one biggest problems character ventura 
 first movie always cool one step ahead every one elseperfect carreys offthewall approach 
 ventura made look lot stupider often made straight guya role definitely carreys style 
 definitely funny moments far 
 also nowhere near funny anything carrey first ace ventura even dumb dumber
