plot rich guy doesnt believe love orders mailorder bride 
 evening couple married fall madly love soon thereafter 
 whats 
one might person pretending 
wow 
sin indeed 
critique easily one worst movies ive seen year 
 long boring predictable ridiculous anyone interested watching good movie 
 hell thinking made thing 
 wonder film sitting racks year felt like really bad tv movie week nudity stuffed time time just wake audience 
 ever switched channels fallen upon one ridiculously melodramatic tv movies one just couldnt help switch back time time just make sure wasnt part sick joke 
well movie exactly like isnt joke isnt tv asked pay money see 
 say shite thinking 
okay start 
first trailer film gives away movies main plot twist betrayal 
 first half hour film youre basically just sitting watching two lovers go motions betrayal occurs 
whoopee big surprise 
second angelina jolie horribly miscast part 
 
well like one second ever believe nasty backstabbing woman 
 mean like people complained jack nicholson psycho start shining well goes 
every look jolies eyes screams psycho 
 course case patsy husband man just cant seem figure anything time 
 mean 
boring audience 
youre watching guy screw time time time somehow supposed feel sorry care dude 
 thanks 
 dont care really dont care shes beeyatch confused actual motivations film hell supposed care film 
well ill tell 
 thing worrying whole way picture whether id actually fall asleep end credits rolled 
 suspense chemistry leads real love passion sense surprise plenty plot holes everyone extra moronic ending 
 even giving film rating three points 
well actually pretty simple 
 liked locations movie groovy score primary reason slipping three notches onto bedpost gratuitous shots jolies boobies thats two points right another one antonios ass hairless just record 
everything else movie pointless boring just plain stupid 
try imagining softporn movie 
without plot 
thats pretty much youve got 
 low point careers stars 
oops almost forgot mention crappy dialogue god 
oh mighty make 
 stop 
wheres joblo coming 
american psycho cruel intentions eyes wide shut fatal attraction playing heart suspicion lies beneath women want whipped
