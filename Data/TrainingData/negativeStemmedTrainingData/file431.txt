 happy bastards quick movie review 
 concept enjoying stupid comedy best realized keeping stupid really 
shift gears even audience can thrown miserably control 
sadly case kingpin film directed farrelly brothers duo brought us theres something mary dumb dumber 
since duo directed didnt write script can assume thats part problem 
 story seems good enough pro bowler s name roy munson woody harrelson sitting top world 
 popularity gone roof hes getting career ground 
 however runs ed mccracken bill murray rival bowler hardly real consideration well anything 
 two form illtimed relationship involves risky betting roy sees coming eds abandoned hes lose hand bowling ball machine 
forward seventeen years later roy become quite loser complete mechanical hand tornup car course occasional knocking uglyass landlord avoid paying rent 
however finds glimmer hope upon visit local bowling alley runs amish kid named ishmael randy quaid quite bowling arm 
 kids help figures can known particularly biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching reno nevada 
 course amish kid needs coaxing particularly consider well hes amish 
 leads best comic scenes film roys process removing horseshoes milking cow 
finally duo get road along way pick additional helper beautiful hustler played gorgeous vanessa angel 
 main problem kingpin wasnt fact wasnt funny 
 fact rather hilarious scenes aformentioned roys explanation children something involving cheese grater 
 thats just scenes 
theres couple really serious scenes throw entire momentum movie like abuse angel takes hustler exboyfriend 
 mean really necessary 
couldnt handled just bit wackier 
 mean comedy throw ethics 
particularly farrelly brothers vehicle hair gel can easily mistaken 
 really ruined however thats bad 
 acting top notch especially angel murray really funny scenes worth noting 
still youre going think dumb think dumb way ok 
 least farrelly brothers got back track mary id still little bit irked
