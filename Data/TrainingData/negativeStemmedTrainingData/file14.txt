 movie like mortal kombat annihilation works must reviewed multiple levels 
first theres rampant usage randian subtext pervades entire movie 
 occasionaly almost making ironic selfdepreciating remark movie tosses clearly marxist imagery 
 
just kidding 
 going moment didnt 
 seriousness however fair movie necessary provide two viewpoints movie watcher unfamiliar marginally familiar whole mortal kombat phenomenon fan first movie andor fan games 
 first movie mortal kombat concerned martial arts tournament decide fate earth billion inhabitants 
 mortals won theory prevented emperor shao khan taking earth 
unfortunately shao khan poor loser final scene mortal kombat showed arriving anyway ready take planet heroes assumed fighting stance 
 first movie extraordinarily entertaining like fans game 
id even go far say many folks didnt know game probably enjoyed movie 
 writers directors knew limitations cast basic story didnt try overachieve 
 lot really cool fight scenes really cool accompanying music intersperesed distracting ultimately nonintrusive bits fluff passing plot 
 know movie smashing success box office 
mortal kombat annihilation picks precisely movie left introductory exposition clue may seen first movie 
shao khan decided hes going take earth anyways hell silly rule mortals winning tournament 
thereafter follows approximately minutes film alternates confused trite silly just plain stupid 
one gets general impression producers movie thought hey last movie success can get money make real movie now 
 bad didnt simply stick formula first movie 
 write volumes things wrong picture high points 
 acting truly bad 
sandra hess playing sonya blade character particularly execrable especially scenes tries convince us loved johnny cage character first movie gets greased beginning movie 
 one worst pieces miscasting think ive ever seen james remar plays raiden god thunder 
 first movie christopher lambert played raiden played character though joke french actor playing japanese thunder god revered chinese mystics 
 generally like actors cast type tim tiny lister jr cast president u s fifth element example remar always one favorite utility actors hes totally wrong part doesnt even luxury amused selfawareness 
 many characters introduced potentially important never seen 
 number completely meaningless story sidetracks including muddled scene liu kang robin shou seeks nightwolf litefoot mystical hallucination wanders jade irina pantaeva 
 reasons many others can give movie 
 unless youre huge fan games andor first movie 
 case following critiques also apply 
 sandra hess even worse actress bridgette wilson played sonya blade first movie much convincing fighter 
wilson looked like simply mimicing movements taught fight choreographer 
hess looks like actually knows martial arts puts together much believable fight scene 
 fights characters least one thing game often 
sonya kiss death jax earthquake liu kang animality 
 big bonus us looking similar moves first movie found rarely 
 arent many fight scenes movie first folks making movie mistakenly try hang robust plot 
silly silly folks 
 lamest fight involved two women turns mudwrestling match 
lame obviously sexist even politically incorrect part noticed remarked upon 
 special effects generally better except final fight scene emporer liu kang perform animalities 
motaro sheeva convincing lifelike goro first movie 
 folks like loved first movie enjoy games give 
youll probably like nearly much liked first one
