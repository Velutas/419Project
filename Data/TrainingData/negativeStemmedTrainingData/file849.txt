 suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche 
 clumsy criminal oaf add laughs cliche 
 bad guy owns wild animal cliche 
 crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche 
 intense moment main character tries get away car trouble starting cliche 
complaining cliches cliche 
ok ok 
 always hear cliches 
 ever prime example real mccoy 
 one uttered word one frame film one character whole movie isnt cut paste example everything weve ever seen 
 might well use training film make bank robbery film s 
karen mccoy kim basinger bank robber just got parole sixyear stay state prison 
 wants make things right go straight especially fact sixyear old son doesnt even know shes alive 
aware mccoys bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses sixyear old coerce mccoy returning past 
 wants mccoy pull elaborate heist million dollars bank got caught trying rob six years earlier way somehow due schmidt 
 refuses 
 knows hell kid 
 cue sinister laughter 
 movie pathetically pitiful hard know begin 
 aforementioned cliches brutally abundant 
 cant stress enough every single element whether character dialogue plot twist etc damn generic youll wonder anyone working behind scenes let alone front camera 
basinger absolutely vacant 
 get trying make us emotionally attached 
heres someone spent time robbing banks now heads onto street supposed feel sorry 
 confronts son doesnt even know supposed break tears 
especially neither basinger zach english plays kid depth emotionalradiance whatsoever 
 suppose mention val kilmer 
yeah thats right hes 
quite sadly seeing can discuss everything movie never mention name 
 got second billing 
 fair will admit kilmer potential role bumbling criminal wannabe j t 
barker 
unfortunately script doesnt allow much room improvement character used like bookends never shows middle film 
 time appreciate might brought project 
 real mccoy just cant keep head water soon soon sinks cliched mess movie 
 actors like dummies moved unenthusiastic puppeteer dialogue particularly schmidts trite dialogue falls like niagra 
 definitely one avoid folks 
 real mccoy anything
