synopsis sooner think america future law enforcement resides blade squad ragtag group culturally diverse rollerblading cops jetpacks strapped backs 
 dangerous criminal however attempts destroy blade squad brother dies chased 
comments exgangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop former prostitute substance abuse problem junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop crashed four police cruisers common 
 theyre members blade squad elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms rollerblades jetpacks 
 also carry video cameras can communicate one another la marines james camerons aliens 
yes blade squad fox networks wednesday night movie week 
 movie marking dubious world premiere today curiously number guest stars 
 can movie guest stars 
 may ask 
well blade squad really movie speak hour pilot possible tv series packaged movie 
blade squad dumb 
blade squad loud 
blade squad obnoxious 
blade squad will probably ratings hit spawn longlived tv series 
 
 television given audience crimefighters talking cars knight rider fast helicopters airwolf super fast motorcycles street hawk viewers eaten past 
 crimefighters jetpowered roller blades 
 honest madefortv presentation blade squad least watchable 
 film relatively large cast characters surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script enough action sequences keep one halfinterested 
id imagine adolescent males probably target audience turkey get kick 
 tried keep mind watched blade squad 
 can remember liking airwolf street hawk 
 although isnt saying much blade squad leaps bounds better last fox network movie displeasure wasting time insipidly awful generation x huge disappointment considering comic books terrific twoyear beginning 
 digress 
despite limited appeal blade squad lot kinks work movie become tv series 
one suffers mtv syndrome lot quick shots weird angles continuously jar viewers senses near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly background 
oh yeah dylans knockin heavens door bowies im afraid americans used rather poor taste 
two blade squad needs new crew sound 
 substandard sound editing irritated end 
characters dialogue times sounded choppy unintelligible 
 one important scene song played loudly background 
 character spoke songs volume dropped disappear 
 soon character finished speaking songs volume immediately returned original level next character spoke 
 sounds trivial im sure distracted immensely 
finally commercial television 
foul language allowed typically commercial television 
thus dont use foul language madefortv production foul language censored manner 
 early scene film example lead good guy bad guy minor confrontation streets 
 good guy spouts bad word driver conveniently honks cars horn offscreen muffle word 
 seinfeld episode technique proved funny seemed goofy cut dramatic tension considerably 
perhaps future writers show spun movie take cue marvel comics series comics 
make bunch new bad words future 
 way dont need bunch honking horns silly devices cover foul language 
compared usual crap broadcast tv networks offer terms movies blade squad suitable exercise camp 
 compared say movie studio film blade squad lot common term shares initials bs
