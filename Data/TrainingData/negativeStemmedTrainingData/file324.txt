plot rich psychiatrist great home life gets cute daughter kidnapped bad guys want extract information mind one nutty patients 
 course patient cooperative doctor hours comply demands kill daughter 
pretty good premise 
critique youre fan movies packed plot holes inconsistencies yes even plot holes heed words skip hollow thriller 
 dont like saying either since film actually potential started pretty well 
sure story basically just amalgamation ransom primal fear nick time pureed one whole psychiatrist working clock thing actually engaged first 
 halfway mark movie bottom drops left lot questions plausible answers 
 get overly smart kid manages pull one bad guys 
 get weak woman leg cast beating crap tough bad guy 
 get douglas character new york uppedity psychiatrist suddenly turning action hero moves attitude boot 
 films main plot point 
 bad guys still give crap thing years even give shrink days end part 
 waited years whats another days set another heist instead 
ill tell wouldnt bad movie otherwise thats 
 many many 
ugh whatever case just time douglas character suddenly removed murphys character mental home come went nicely 
 thought didnt trust turned buddy asked movie turned joke 
 bogus chase action sequences later left longwinded ending little answer questions mightve still actually brought even contradictions 
badly put together movie features decent acting nice cinematography initially interesting premise loses haze plot miscues ultimately leave little care anyone 
 fact wasnt brittany murphys excellent portrayal traumatized teen jennifer espositos embarrassing performance police woman yeah right 
watching delivering lines funniest part flick wasnt supposed michael douglas cool regular guy part little reason remain seated end picture 
incidentally can anyone please give one good reason espositos character movie first place 
 completely superfluous 
 top end flick director seems realized dumb audience must bought garbage hed shoveling hour half prior decides add insult injury flashing back earlier characters death one bad guys dies just know audience two interrelated somehow 
ooooh thanks mr fleder 
appreciate spoonfeeding dude yum 
yum 
 explaining every plot point film made sense 
whatever 
either way dont give rats ass movie dog thats unfortunate actually good points going 
see like dumb thrillers 
incidentally appreciated along came spider will likely enjoy film well 
 start interesting premises toss logic sense window halfway 
wheres joblo coming 
along came spider girl interrupted kiss girls primal fear seven
