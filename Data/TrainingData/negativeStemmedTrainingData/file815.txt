now th warrior presents tribe flesh eating men believe bears 
 story thats want call follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas arabian poet falls love kings wife banished home land 
 travels land vikings becomes ambassador 
eventually vikings called upon protect people village hunted flesh eating men 
thirteen warriors chosen go mission guessed ahmed chosen thirteenth 
hes warrior first well accepted vikings movie advances hell prove battlefield 
thats basically entire plot 
 also romantic subplot badly mishandled one assumes drastically cut begin wonder filmmakers didnt just edit scenes attaining part story 
instead chose leave just enough scenes annoy viewer 
 film basically non stop action pauses tries develop story becomes laughing stock 
 battle scenes although well choreographed involving least bit exciting 
 dont get know characters dont care lives dies 
 film wants beowolf comes across failed actionadventure story aspiring epic proportions achieving levels 
 directed john mctiernan whos thomas crown affair also playing theaters currently 
 mctiernan worked simultaneously films th warrior placed shelf long studio just waiting time dump audiences 
 belongs back shelf
