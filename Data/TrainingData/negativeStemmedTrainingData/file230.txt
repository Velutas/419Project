 amazing comedian can funniest standup around completely fall flat movies 
take adam sandler 
 basis first two cds theyre gonna laugh 
 hell happened 
hes best thing hit comedy since robin williams 
 put front camera just isnt 
 kind enjoyed happy gilmore thought warranted marginal recommendation latest film waterboy funny root canal 
seriously im willing wager laughs saving private ryan 
 fact found movie depressing comedic 
 first half hour generated one smile scenes emotional abuse towards adams character bobby boucher cruel football players also disturbed mother kathy bates world coming 
granted film gets rolling mild chuckles throughout im even willing admit actually laughing twice nearly enough sustain waterboy nearly hour half running time 
youre familiar plot youve seen least million times everyone picks hero shows hidden talent leads underdog team victory champions process winning respect teammates also getting woman loves 
 believe im giving anything away saying sandlers team wins 
 actually feel degree suspense watching movie god 
 things keep bomb getting big banana winning performances henry winkler insecure coach severely underrated fairuza balk bobbys love interest 
 mean lending talents loftier purpose extremely well given 
kudos 
 advice adam try follow footsteps veteran comedians like williams steve martin made smooth successful transition stage screen 
rely actual comedy rather strange voices rude noises make people laugh 
 maybe even show dramatic talent might like jim carrey recent truman show 
 obvious considerable talent possesses just cant keep going like
