movies based video games street fighter mario bros never generated much interest box office 
 first mortal kombat movie came surprisingly well 
 simple story pulsating soundtrack lots awesomely choreographed fight scenes movie moved quickly displayed lots energy 
 got vote movie expected least got 
 havent opportunity definitely recommend see video 
 world mortal kombat based popular arcade game dark forces outworld try infiltrate earths realm ulimate goal total conquest destruction humanity 
 mortal kombat refers competition fought human mortals outworlds minions won will guarantee earths safety another generation 
mk picks almost immediately humans return victoriously competition 
despite victory however gateway somehow opened outworld continues quest conquer earth 
outworlds warriors include impressive collection fighters including shao kahn mintoro centaur sheeva fourarmed ogre sindel 
earths mortal warriors leadership benevolent god lord rayden includes liu kang princess kitana sonya blade jax must fight outworlds forces 
 easy enough premise unfortunately unfortunately writers try much movie 
 video game onscreen version tries go beyond comic book boundaries adding depth conceptualization selfworth worst love story 
 becomes awkward players fighters nothing 
 likable impressive showcasing martial arts fighting skills look extremely awkward uncomfortable required actually act 
 becomes embarrassingly apparent example movie tries develop romantic bond liu kang princess kitana 
 original mk smart letting players best 
 spoke little fought lot 
thus movie easy digest 
however mk tries give players certain amount depth element lacking first movie attempt fails miserably 
 uneasy feeling readily apparent example whenever hear lord rayden speak 
 talk riddles offer enigmatic e g 
useless advice speaks slowly simulate infinite wisdom 
try reading half fast youll hear mean 
 movie complete fatality 
fight scenes wellchoreographed highlighted terrific acrobatics agility 
 players game will rewarded inclusion practically every character video game although screen time amounts nothing cameo 
even youre familiar video game fighter costume unique weaponry easily differentiate 
 just little moviegoers especially fans game will expect 
oddly inclusion human element actually pollutes purity mortal kombat essence 
 poor acting results muddled movie offers viewing audience little chance survival 
 now talking slowly simulate infinite wisdom 
rent first one sequel kombat fans
