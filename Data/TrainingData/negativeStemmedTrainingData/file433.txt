robin williams time without beard returns drama sloppy sickly sweet fantasy redeeming features apart incredible effects 
 plays chris nielsen meets annie annabella sciora promptly marries 
 two great kids sadly die car crash 
just couldnt get worse chris gets killed car crash goes heaven meets guide albert gooding jnr 
annie cant take grief anymore kills 
 sounding like good fun far 
 penalty suicide go hell chris goes mission try rescue using help traveller max von sydow 
based novel twilight zone writer richard matheson dreams may come clunky manufactured material doused extra load sugar 
 worse spielberg film spielberg never made 
everything wrong movie performances forced audiences fail relate characters 
williams puts convincing upset face thats face 
theres emotion behind 
scioras performance lazy bogs whole film 
 may look pretty cant act 
max von sydow o k traveller nothing special 
cuba gooding jnr thankfully adds bounce performance certainly best performer film 
 shame character flat d offers room improvement 
 performers work soppy script tries best get emotion going never takes ground 
 scenes real heartwarmers faceless characters dont help get anything performers 
 films like e t used great actors music direction pull masterful hearttugging scene dreams may come haphazard expecting emotion come scene automatically 
instead rather boring 
sure music pretty michael kamen cinematography isnt bad eduardo serra theres something lacking 
 script doesnt help filled hopeless romantic clich s dud speeches 
richard matheson can write awesome science fiction stories sadly novel look embarrassed bargain bin let alone converted million vehicle robin williams 
despite set heaven dreams may come mightily depressing 
 film rushes happy ending everything sad black just adds make ending even hopeless stupid 
 theres one redeeming feature failure movie special effects 
heaven hell truly incredible places actors fit perfectly virtual sets 
 despite dreams may come proves nothing biggest disappointment 
instead raising questions existence raises boredom 
sadly recommend give film miss 
better luck next time robin
