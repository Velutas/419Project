 movies just skip 
 daughter really vile time favorite martian weeks back comes another disney effectsfilled liveaction flick based old tv program 
true probgram years old time cartoon 
 cartoon liked understandably reluctant see disney done big screen 
 daughter really wanted go bad 
turns right mostly 
inspector gadget oddly enough follows almost exactly format favorite martian jivetalking sidekick 
 first thought done people imdb informs ig directed david kellogg written dana olsen kerry ehrin mfm directed donald petrie written sherri stoner deanna oliver 
 odd similarity two movies may best explained studio produced formula isnt just business way life 
 producers obviously micromanaged two projects get prominant screen credits 
 parts can just hear saying zany 
 want zany 
 lets really painful sexual reference reason right make really painful 
 want audience squirming seats 
 ok thats fine want add bug guts 
 scene 
character depth 
 wheres zaniness 
 dont see zany 
 cant make zany cut 
 latter explanation can come absence thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg movie 
michelle plays penny gadgets niece shines every scene shes unfortunately gets nine minutes screen time 
 guess rest cutting room floor 
dabney colemans comedic talents utterly wasted chief quimby 
 kept expecting say something really funny somehow save film instead best can really poor lines unexceptional scenes 
 thoroughly upstaged cheri oteri gidget bitch hell town mayor 
oteris overly enthusiastic continually selfcongratulatory speech patterns mannerisms much like portland oregons manic mayor vera katz wonder studio wasnt poking fun fair town 
 maybe career politicians like 
 must say matthew broderick stroll inspector gadget godzilla 
 appears fun film especially evil gadget 
rupert everett entertaining maniacle claw 
joely fisher fine zany scientist even better zany carbon copy 
 performance one things worth watching film 
d l hughley plays shuckinandjivin vehicular sidekick role firmly sets emancipation back years 
 dialog lets face pretty bad 
 tagline major setpiece battle faux pas makes sense context 
 lot lines especially hughleys appear made go along people little gift adlib 
 threequarters film somewhat unnecessary origin story gadget claw 
gadget spends latter third movie trying locate claw various altercations really battles evil gadget 
penny minute half detective work character every week cartoon 
let rage just minute 
michelle trachtenberg excellent choice penny character 
shes utterly charming excellent experience harriet spy part pintsize detective 
 underutilized film real mystery 
 film loses star casting brilliance coupled scripting editing stupidity 
inspector gadget missing long long stretches potty humor among things made favorite martian unbearable short movie perhaps something cut last moment 
probably best scenes film occur end credits 
 evil sidekick support group especially worth seeing amazing number cameo appearances seconds onscreen 
 another bad live action film premere studio bad live action films 
 wonder disney uses revenues generally moneymaking cartoons produce losers 
 true 
 theyre trying another mary poppins need find team can produce one give chance
