keep cool chinese film directed semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang one kickoff films years hawaii international film festival 
 day premiered lines eager moviegoers stretched around block anticipants queued well advance get good seat theater 
 need wasted time 
 movie billed comedy surprisingly bereft humor 
 noticeable attempts laughs tries actually click 
 wondered jokes wasnt getting im china unfortunately conclusion lack humor couldnt attributed cultural barrier either 
keep cool just isnt funny 
 prelude film visit keep cools producer help interpreter regaled us order get print festival time assistant hand carried plane china hawaii 
although print made assistants luggage lost 
 bad story wasnt movie got big laugh 
qu ying films female lead also hand give comments 
however whereas producer politely made regular pauses dialog interpreter bring us speed ms ying saw fit say everything say one fastpaced incredibly long tirade 
 dizzying good foreshadowing film 
 see keep cool filmed almost totally camera handheld man bad case shakes 
 least thats way seems since camera constantly moving 
cinema verite one thing panning shaking around audience headache another 
although might consider form helps give viewer idea anarchic state chinese youth slowly growing found thoroughly distracting quite annoying 
headache said 
 film young bookseller wen jiang young woman qu ying 
 used romantically involved woman grew tired left relationship 
 first half film young mans plan win back 
 course thing doesnt want won back nightclub owner friend rough bit 
 fight young man grabs laptop computer belonging bystander attempts use fend attacker ends smashing lamppost 
 later find laptop belongs older man wishes get damaged computer replaced 
 funny scene one film young man tries use twisted logic order get older man seek nightclub owner baotian li order recoup losses 
 sense made young womans behavior cold one minute caring next feel sympathy character 
 bookseller better without 
although second half film causes us lose lot sympathy young bookseller well obsessed chopping nightclub owners hand revenge beating took also offers us nice interaction bookseller older man 
 bookseller blinded thirst revenge older man voice reason tries rationalize situation 
 quest end dispute peacefully equitably one identify frustrating see seems talking brick wall half time 
 friendship develops two men occurs late film audience appreciate 
although hour half length keep cool contains extraneous material 
 whole plot bookseller young woman taken since dont see midpoint 
 case mistaken identity device served point conflict bookseller nightclub owner saved us booksellers boring pursuit first half 
 course shortened movie less hour 
 things keep cool right 
 mentioned interaction bookseller older man generally pretty good 
although grows tiresome reasoning unreasonable nice exercise logic represents differences thinking generations 
 one scene example bookseller quotes confucius get point across older man claims quote misinterpreted means something entirely different 
also effective way zhang sets tension within scene bookseller getting ready cut hand unwitting nightclub owner 
 nightclub owner counting money slapping bundle currency table 
 every shot hand can hardly stand interminable wait bookseller going pull cleaver exact revenge 
unfortunately crumbs enough overcome rest films shortcomings werent enough prevent headache lingering left theater
