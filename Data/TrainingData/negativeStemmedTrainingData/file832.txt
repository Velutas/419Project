one blatantly obvious signs oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets gloria remake john cassavetes film absolutely effect occurred driving home theatre 
suddenly realized since stood theatre seat five minutes thought film just invested nearly two hours life 
 movie arent supposed think conversation acquaintances just watched 
 thought one saw particular picture even someone wouldnt anything talk first place 
 sure gloria begins stirring rather poignant prologue sevenyearold boys family brutally gunned mobsters search disc father incriminating evidence 
right men broke course father gave disc escape 
eventually boy named nicky nunez jeanluke figueroa caught mobsters taken back apartment 
meanwhile gloria sharon stone just gotten prison crime didnt commit returns exboyfriend jeremy northam recieve money promised covering crime 
 refuses give hears group men talking killing nicky leaves order save life holding men gunpoint stealing money forcing strip nude 
gloria type fasttalking smartmouthed new yorker always seems get involved wrong people never expected stuck kid heart gold dont always type movie trying protect boy quickly begins form close bond 
 previous incarnation gloria cassavetes starring luminous gena rowlands remains unseen doubt superior even though cant really imagine considerably dull story transformed entertaining one regardless director stars 
 doubt mind director lumet stuck closely original film simply lifeless occasional laugh popping isnt completely unbearable watch 
 liked example funny climactic sequence gloria deciding whether leave school left boy keeps turning car around driving little ways slamming brakes turning around 
 bright moments however appear long far majority film deals budding relationship nicky gloria painfully predictable bythenumbers 
throughout mind repeatedly asking question really cares 
 gloria sharon stone adopted overthetop brooklyn accent honestly doesnt sound realistic 
 beginning fact amazed amateurish stones performance film progressed got better 
although one better turns stone comic flare refuses ignored 
jeanluke figeroa fine nicky little natural usual child actors precocious make want gag 
 actors appeared considerably wasted none cathy moriarty entertaining actress right billed fourth one scene glorias friend turns help 
sony studio released gloria obviously faith film dont blame 
 declined screen picture critics never good sign particularly highprofile people involved 
although much money movie makes determine good just look spectacular dreams failed even make top last week suspicion gloria going vanish theaters faster ishtar judging opening night p m showing saw ten fifteen people present counting 
although stone can impressive actress just watch s casino s last dance dont believe sidney lumet can respectable director reasoning thought cliched story gloria worth remaking matter columbia pictures agreed finance making picture actually looked like might inkling chance successful
