 first rule fight club dont talk fight club 
 quote deals directly opinion film quite frankly even worth mentioning 
director david fincher seven completely gone edge 
 crude humor intolerable script hours minutes pure torture im surprised didnt walk 
 just goes show hype kills 
 rare film hyped fight club turns noteworthy exception 
 story goes like 
edward norton insomniac trying enlighten dull life going variety disease therapy sessions meets marla helena bonham carter 
norton claims wrecking pleasurable lifestyle spots session also attended 
apparently disease sessions help see life like literally living pain 
 person think thing beyond things get worse 
norton soon assigned job calls traveling plane meets tyler durden brad pitt 
 two men develop bond go bar golly get drunk two pitiful characters fight 
 come stuff 
anyway fighting catches pathetic losers attention club formed 
 mess manages lie message 
fincher shows us society like robots 
 work jobs things step step want 
 insanity gets brain makes things worse really blame others 
call crazy common knowledge 
 think fincher acting film moodier poignant really probably one reasons fails miserably 
even two good actors solid actress manage weaken story 
 couldnt help hide face shame norton beats bloody pulp 
 just shows desperate script attention 
 guess brad pitt right role felt like beating 
 bothersome depressing character made disgusted million fee 
 showed money nothing 
helena bonham carter however really purpose 
 just popped screen mumbled lines smoked left 
 continues seems like hours 
 film drags headache gets bigger fight club nears think might end 
unfortunately film hits rock bottom 
though conclusion kept interest mere minutes backs continues move snails pace 
 side note trailer shows redeeming elements film coincidentally lasts amount time trailer 
fincher will hopefully regret making film least learn lesson 
concentrating atmosphere particular key moment wont good everything else need support 
also im afraid immature men might respond films violence 
 last thing world needs people praising leader pointless cult 
 film ends im just glad get home take advil 
youll either enjoy film offer agree ed norton says f ing stupid
