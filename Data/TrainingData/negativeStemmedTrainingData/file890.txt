 meticulously go files revisit old witnesses wonder might cranky old women slam door faces course relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming hurricanes innocence either ignored never seeked first two proceedings 
 course already told hes innocent 
 movie like especially frustrating shown everything significant happened carter period life 
 obviously getting hollywood watered version 
 ok except parts getting milked every single drop melodrama filmmakers possibly squeeze 
 almost cruel 
 melodrama isnt entertaining kind either hokey rammeddownyourthroat variety every emotion exaggerated point absurdity 
witness villain ferociously grinding teeth final trial constant pseudosaintliness four protagonists 
 hurricane basic courtroom movie except nofrills courtroom movie 
 formula stripped bare necessities 
 wrongly accused black man 
 melodramatic final courtroom scene 
 theres nothing else 
youd expect sort involving investigation 
 thats necessary since implicitly informed innocence 
thus whole middle portion movie reduced protagonist brooding 
brooding 
brooding inmates 
brooding lesra 
brooding lesras canadian friends 
brooding letters 
 dont think ill ever look brooding way 
 wasnt long got tired hearing hurricanes exceedingly deep meditations condition 
 wanted something happen

 theyre play major part movie make real people real feelings emotions 
look youre going make formula movie dont undermine formula 
courtroom dramas can fun ridiculous 
 trite boring
