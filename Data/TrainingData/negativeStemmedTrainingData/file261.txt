 never star trek fan tell truth five films series seen disliked 
 however always go one open mind ninth film series star trek insurrection exception 
dropping almost completely hardcore scifi element previous one series first contact insurrection tells story planet holds people known baku well fountain youth 
 start picture villagers go attack second alien species known sona want push baku race will die 
also attacking baku data brent spiner robot star trek enterprise 
 returning jeanluc picard patrick stewart gang space ship one can understand data somehow taken another force 
 several star trek members travel planet baku picard meets starts fall love one inhabitants sultry kind alien woman donna murphy sixhundredyearsold looks thirties 
 star trek insurrection completely unoriginal cheaplooking installment series big step s first contact least appeared try make something bit different 
 insurrection however plays like lowrent episode television show due smallscale generic storyline emphasis oneliners rather excitement 
 film filled nearly nonstop comedy worse yet fell flatter cartoon character drops cliff 
meanwhile action sequences interesting inventive relying old reliable ticking timer counts slowly 
 plot device seen just every action film made nowadays getting old fast 
 filmmakers bankrupt ingenuity ideas must always timer ticking away climax 
another element star trek films general picard seems always love interest always miraculously disappears next film made two three years later 
although donna murphy falls victim thankless love interest role actually one characters get know minute running time alfre woodard far superior first contact 
 returned one dont blame wanting waste time movies disappointing often lifeless screenplay michael piller 
 star trek insurrection perhaps weakest film star trek series although seen widely considered worst star trek v final frontier 
 insurrection type safe sequel will bewilder nonfans since lowtech compared todays blockbuster action films although honestly good either disappoint loyal trekkies since easily better makers realized screenplay needed go drafts 
 second thought probably completely thrown script 
 way come story least sign intelligence freshness
