lengthy lousy two words describe boring drama english patient 
great acting music cinematography nice many dull subplots characters made film hard follow 
ralph fiennes strange days schindlers list gives gripping performance count laszlo almasy victim amnesia horrible burns world war ii italy 
 story revolves around past flashback form making even confusing 
anyway taken hana juliette binoche horseman roof boring wartorn nurse 
 never really made anything met indian towards end developing yet another subplot 
count almasy begins remember happened explained stranger willem dafoe basquiat 
 love kirstin scott thomas mission impossible severely injured plane crash eventually died cave 
 returned find dead heartbroken 
 flew dead body somewhere shot ground 
dont get wrong idea may sound good trailer may tempting good last thing film 
maybe hour less may tolerable hours minutes talking much handle 
 redeeming qualities film fine acting fiennes dafoe beautiful desert cinematography 
 english patient full worthless scenes boredom wastes entirely much film
