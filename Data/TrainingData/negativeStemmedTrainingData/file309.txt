eddie murphy lot riding harlem nights 
 movies writer director executive producer star murphy will shoulder blame harlem nights fails 
 time hell receive credit succeeds 
 sacrifice hardearned cash support murphys risky gamble 
well depends trust eddie murphy 
heres murphy thinks think audience expecting good time 
 gonna get sexy 
 gonna get funny 
 gonna get drama 
 gonna get 
 think best movie ive done paramount radio network 
heres think harlem nights charmless unoriginal disappointing almost without question worst film actors career havent seen best defense 
 guess whos blame 
 movies problem murphys direction harlem nights fairly good looking film 
 project probably doomed even cameras rolled 
murphys awful script culprit 
lets count mistakes makes first attempt screenwriting 
 murphy shatters record profanity motion picture 
yes even outdoes work raw 
practically every line dialogue harlem nights contains least one four letter word 
 minutes gets irritating 
 murphy wastes talents fine cast 
richard pryor redd foxx michael lerner della reese face impossible task carving credible characters script riddled stereotypes 
 shines occasionally basically good performers stuck bad vehicle 
 movie demeans women depicting solely sexual objects pawns power struggles men 
murphy admitted interviews weary women private life really neither 
 murphy puts bitter feelings movie screens across country another matter altogether 
youre forced swallow pretty gruesome stuff 
 instance murphy punches della reese stomach 
 shoots jasmine guy head 
 meanspirited movie folks 
lovely newcomer lela rochon gets easy role common whore doesnt scenes murphy 
thank god might run bulldozer 
 murphy written perhaps blandest role date 
 loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges twice film 
murphy rather give character spiffy wardrobe spiffy personality 
sometimes seems murphy made harlem nights just wear fancy suits look debonair 
 plot shameless ripoff sting 
 youre going make another sting movie youve got something original 
murphys tale warring nightclub owners harlem circa fails add anything new formula 
 get laughs murphy makes fun stuttering 
 know comedy digging deep resorts ridiculing handicapped 
 murphys idea drama scene character apologizes first time life 
 
 shooting reeses little toe 
needless say murphy shows little promise imagination screenwriter 
 fairness however rays sunshine manage break gloomy cloud surrounding movie 
danny aiello fun watch dirty cop take 
aiello stands large ensemble cast obviously relishes opportunity play nasty character racist detective mob ties 
aiellos zesty performance gives harlem nights much needed spice 
another bright spot arsenio hall hilarious showstopping cameo crybaby gangster hall virtually steals spotlight murphy 
 fact halls ten minutes screen funniest ten minutes movie 
unfortunately character completely irrelevant plot murphy given hall much bigger role 
 course ive already mentioned didnt care murphys character admit love neckties 
 simply spectacularalmost worth price admission
