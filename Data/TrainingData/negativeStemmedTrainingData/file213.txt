capsule bad sequel crow batman robin still horribly putrid cheesy illconceived 
 one belongs saturday morning cartoons 
extended review know halfway movie realized hacked everything except fight scenes youd damn fine minutes flashy hong kong style martial arts 
beautifully choreographed robin shou also plays liu kang fight scenes mindblowing graceful acrobatic enough make olympic gymnasts weep 
 made original fun unfortunately sequel without frenetic directorial style paul anderson 
instead got john r leonetti cinematographer original mortal kombat 
 good choice 
 fight scenes brutal eyepopping rest movie looks like standard made tv fare 
 acting subpar endure directors style b special effects c treatment story characters 
 mr leonetti go back lighting opinion 
 say dozens bad things way overuses slowmotion eye action cant get even mediocre performances actors 
 far worst move way treated jumping 
apparantly everybody can now fly 
hell im occaisional gravity defying flip kick whatnot happens every minutes done poorly 
better jumping acrobatics seen xena warrior princess 
 short gotten paul anderson back 
 least let robin shou direct 
b unlike first one whose sfx vibrant somewhat realistic mk special effects bland fake looking overall just plain bad 
 counted least half dozen times bluescreening painfully obvious 
 movie made s groundbreaking 
 todays industry doesnt even look finished 
c now really bad parts 
 admit im avid fan mortal kombat series 
 games amusing diversions easy way work stress anger 
 first movie mindlessly fun thrillride 
 really cool movie 
 isnt 
 writers apparantly deemed necessary lower target audience teens preschoolers 
 plot elements just plain stupid 
 stupid 
take instance heroes move around 
 use giants spheres roll around underground supposedly thousands miles per hour oh 
boy 
even worse treatment secondary characters 
blink youll miss em 
 characters depth video games 
 thought batman robin bad aint seen nothin yet 
 good characters introduced kick somebody around bit either die forgotten 
theres explanation 
 final blasphemy fight fans waiting rabidly fight hyped intricate movie lasted minutes just sort ended 
 almost made weep 
 sum rent video fastforward everything except fight scenes
