 s falling hoped joel schumacher mature great director 
since offered us two soso adaptations john grisham novels client time kill two batman movies lowered standards franchise 
although disappointments dampened enthusiasm schumachers potential publicity latest release mm raised new hope 
 promised something unusual 
 wasnt 
 plot goes like tom welles nicolas cage private eye hired wealthy woman allegorically named mrs christian myra carter investigate mm movie found among late husbands belongings 
 movie appears snuff film teenage girl raped murdered man leather mask reminds bane schumachers batman robin 
 murders can realistically simulated movies mrs christian wants tom discover girl alive dead 
 combing missing persons reports tom finds girls name tracks los angeles 
 aid max california joaquin phoenix video store clerk another symbolic name tom wanders underworld pornography search snuff 
 plot bears obvious resemblance paul schraders hardcore father goes deeper deeper industries porn sex find missing daughter 
 films modeled dantes inferno course mm makes connection overly obvious casting max virgil constantly tell tom heading toward meeting devil 
 hardcore much subtle meaningful film 
 mm lot promise 
 better moments examination violence entertainment beast within even nice guy like tom 
one moment first sort first meet max hes reading truman capotes cold blood underneath cover porn novel 
 cold blood father truecrime genre literary equivalent snuff films 
max promises will see examples second theme tells tom dance devil devil dont change devil changes 
tom changeill let discover specifics yourselfbut permanently 
schumacher screenwriter andrew kevin walker didnt guts take tom far dark tunnel couldnt come back 
 walkers seven much better job theme refusing compromise

however unlike predictable fare genrelast years twilight example mm especially disappointing much
