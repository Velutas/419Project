 get mix together plot elements various successful scifi films close encounters third kind space odyssey apollo contact 
well whatever youd sure hell hope thousand times better shoddy attempt melange considering disastrous results left 
 film takes little bit everything ultimately adds lot nothing 
 like said 
movie sucks 
plot rescue crew astronauts sent mars year unknown energy force leads loss contact previous gang space aviators visit red planet 
critique extremely underwhelming best way describe movie 
uneven another 
 trailer movie actually showed promise buzz around soso even film starts decent first twenty minutes leading believe actually going go somewhere 
 isnt long entire movie downshifts neutral features space walks anything interesting cherrycolored planet tries hard get us pain characters unsuccessfully tosses romance mix 
 scifi movie 
well dont know much just seemed like bunch nerdies talking techie jargon hour half figure big secret end secret practically yawning excitement 
ultimately movie starts decent premise joins crew misadventures space main crux journey eventually settles one anticlimactic endings side contact 
mind enjoyed films shrugoftheshoulders ending might just enjoy frivolous ditty well 
 course dont remember contact obvious painfully distracting computer generated effects end story 
ugh 
 friggin mess 
films like generally get wondering brass hollywood 
didnt anybody recognize crappiness script 
didnt read bad dialogue cheezy lines obvious derivative nature work mind director like depalma helm aint saying much 
 course cant really blame brass inclusion jerry oconnell fine crew thespians 
nuff said 
neither can blame depalma cranking juice films musical score last fifteen minutes presumably order wake audience okay get brian scene supposed powerful wow yawn 
ears hurt 
 anything salvageable movie 
sure 
gary sinise another great job cheadle film doesnt completely bore much just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening yes sandtwister effect see commercial well done 
 
 guess say admire filmmakers become much devious product placement strategies oops 
 say admire meant disgusted 
 movie delivers little actual substance offers twobit dialogue masked lot scifi mumbojumbo pretends deep really just sappy eventually just settles ending presenting us pathetic computer graphic part story gives us little think might able get money back sitting rehashed dreck 
go see ninth gate now 
theres great movie 
 personal note think time depalma stop worrying much proverbial minute uninterrupted film sequences start worrying crappy movies getting
