 havent plunked hardearned money yet wild wild west latest summer holiday offering will smith let say right now money will better spent starbucks frappacino ben jerrys sundae 
 treats great relief summer heat 
 contrast film made simmer disappointment 
 can accept fact summer movies tend put weight special effects good stories flavorful characters usually take back seat 
 true star wars episode least film story characters still back seat 
 film found 
 remains hundreds male extras costumed gunslingers foppish aristocrats lots female extras look like cancan dancers clunky foot tall instrument destruction resembles mechanical tarantula 
two men asked stop threat 
one artemus gordon kevin kline inventor uses intellect array disguises best opponents 
among creations false breasts bulletproof vest 
 man jim west will smith prefers shootfirstthenshootsomemore method investigating 
although individual talents must combined achieve success interaction one another merely seemed like second rate twoman vaudevillian act 
 example scene west debonair reserved gordon notes fake breasts filled water rather buckwheat currently filled 
 now touch breast west says 
gordon softly coos approval 
 found groaning kind silliness 
 script fails generate sense drama humor fun matter 
 enjoy klines reserved performance surprised much latitude gave smith 
 will smith just bankable hes even required act 
 director yelling will smith thing 
action 
heres example 
 scene will smith hanged group angry white people 
 must endear crowd escape 
 director yells will smith thing 
action 
 another scene masquerade belly dancer order save comrades 
 will smith thing 
action 
worse still final battle scene aboard mechanical tarantula horrid mess 
 cogs spinning pulleys pulling levers going everywhere look 
theres actually lot imagination work film 
 genuinely clever inventions gizmos introduced imagination wasted film visually cluttered dramatically flat 
 thats bad focus story rather will smith just thing film might palatable 
 turns wild wild west wild wild worst receives vote biggest disappointment year
