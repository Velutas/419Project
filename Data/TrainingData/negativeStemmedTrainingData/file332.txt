 event horizon boundary black hole 
 future also name spaceship vanished tried go faster speed light traversing portable black hole 
naturally setup event horizon 
 movie 
 ship suddenly appears point vanished just outside neptune crew ship called lewis clark go investigate dr william weir creator event horizon gets come along ride 
 youve glanced poster movie know supposedly follows infinite terror 
well dont know terror part infinite certainly seems qualify 
event horizon meanspirited gory sick excuse film 
 starts alien ripoff degenerates pointlessly bloody slasher flick minutes 
 least first minutes interesting ripoff alien 
thats lot can said rest movie seems go forever 
 scary monster movie psychological thriller 
 simply movie tries make viewers feel sick stomach site extreme gore 
youve seen kind movie 
 hellraiser series plenty scenes containing sensibility 
 kind movie respect kind movie hoped died years ago 
 quite possible movie frighten shock audience without resorting nothing gore event horizon takes low road viewers pay price 
 many good respectable performances fishburne neill noticably 
paul andersons direction impressive mortal kombat 
 many nice special effects mostly dealing numerous common objects floating around zerogravity 
 sets beautiful gaze upon 
 richard t jones character cooper hilarious extremely likable characters ive seen recent movies little screen time 
 none can save movie dgrade level film 
 idea ship sort life within walls life knows fears inner skeletons human passengers promising one 
 haunted house story space isnt bad idea 
 final execution extremely disappointing 
thats say philip eisner making feature filmwriting debut doesnt talent 
 first minutes manages make tired premise interesting adding aspects unique flavor ripoff story thats something many writers can 
 even one scene though also tries sicken audience honestly tense feel scene question deals one crew airlock others try save floating space 
 definitely something gift fully display 
 certainly will look forward seeing hope future work fully explores talent story possibilities premise 
 movie degenerates little respect got little enjoyment 
 look forward future film agree laurence fishburnes sentiment god help us
