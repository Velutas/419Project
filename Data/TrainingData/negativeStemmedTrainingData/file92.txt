capsule weakest least engaging alien movies dragged uninvolving story real tension 
alien superscript sad wan entry shaping one best sf sagas ever put screen 
 continues story ripley spacetruckerturnedimpromptusurvivalist seems remarkably uninterested 
 fact movie seems lucky interested anything elegaic limp 
 little nice atmosphere movie telegraphs tragedy beginning 
 end last film aliens ripley two survivors way home 
unfortunately alien pod deposited ship wound triggering ejection escape pod 
 pod crashes firorina prison planet designed house incurably criminally violent 
ripley lives crash others 
 prison grim place even prisons go built around remnants abandoned steelworks provides end technogothic backdrops actors backlit 
lice endemic ripleys head shaved another surreal touch 
 first looks like just hold unwelcome guest company rescue ship can arrive doesnt stay way 
one eggs board wrecked escape pod hatches soon newlygestated alien running amuck 
worse looks like ripley impregnated 
whats weird little tension generates except near end pressure troweled every cheap cinematic form cheating imaginable loud music shaky camerawork etc sigourney weaver become comfortable role well time role underwritten left slack 
 supporting actors also given lot doctor charles dance another rather religious inmate charles s dutton good hiave presence theyre asked anything 
 light impending sequel apparently plays fast loose ending movie will talk ending except say found remarkably good ending drab movie 
 strange desperate improvisational thinking found wind story couldnt driven rest
