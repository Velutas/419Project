 twin surfer dudes stew phil deedle lay bandaged unconscious hospital phil comes first chooses coolest way wake brother 
yanking iv uses like water pistol soak brothers face 
 bit lame physical humor typical disneys meet deedles movie endured watched 
 stopped looking wife screening since every time shed start sticking finger throat 
 shes right bad 
directed without imagination steve boyum whose long background film mainly stunts second unit direction film limps along best 
boyum attempts keep pace moving staging stunts stunts stunts 
amazingly someone background seems incapable finding fresh ones car go road five different times maybe 
 whos counting 
 script james herzfeld whose film tapeheads decade ago awful considered cult classic 
meet deedles however painfully bad rather laughably bad 
 will probably theaters like tornado danger becoming classic anything 
herzfeld treats us gratingly abysmal dialog includes geysers geezer id like put deedle haystack 
 movie opens twins one point describe modestly walking kodak moment celebrating th birthday 
 ride parasail high waters waikiki truant officer pursues jet ski 
 heirs fabulous fortune deedle empire boys sent father camp broken spirit yellowstone transform two laidback beach bums men 
 arrive wetsuits yellowstone theyve got surfboards skateboards hawaiian drink machine size armoire 
 camp gone business mistaken new park rangers 
 rest movie fighting parks overpopulation prairie dogs well deranged exranger played dennis hopper stop old faithful billionth birthday celebration scheduled later week 
hopper made wonderful movies carried away recent favorite propensity choosing truly odoriferous material 
 isnt worst acting meet deedles arguably worst movie hes ever 
steve van wormer paul walker stew phil give lifeless performances 
 actor movie demonstrable talent cute little prairie dog named petey 
even cinematography david hennings prosaic manages make yellowstone look dull 
 add insult injury hennings fond inappropriate closeups serve remind us inanity dialog 
put tenfoot pair lips screen naturally pay extra attention said 
although boyum says notes proud film appropriate families one wonders many skateboarders will attempt movies stunt lying back skateboard negotiating busy twisting mountain road 
 make look like much fun im sure many will try variation stunt 
 possibly worst asks phil 
just suspect cant movie takes turn downhill 
 low point may looking airline barf bag 
 phils girlfriend digs big mount moist soil suck long worm 
like two dog lovers eating spaghetti lady tramp lips finally meet kiss 
 pull back faces full dirt encased worm just ingested 
meet deedles runs hour half 
 rated pg little bathroom humor acceptable kids around 
 son jeffrey friend nickolas almost gave show 
 thought scenes petey among favorites 
nickolas also mentioned scene circus bear drives jeep jeffrey especially liked one circus elephant referred dumbo
