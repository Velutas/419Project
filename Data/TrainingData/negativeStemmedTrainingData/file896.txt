 days valley less pulp fiction knock 
 basically involves bunch quirky characters los angeles area end lives become intertwined unusual ways 
im going much greater detail since take forever explain quite frankly im willing spend time hours ive already wasted 
 tries hard pulp fiction days valley falls way short 
 quite condemnation considering cast includes danny aiello james spader jeff daniels 
 story isnt much dialogue characters rate marginally better days valley couple bright spots 
james spaders character much better rest least fun watch sick sort way 
 get see nice cat fight uber babes teri hatcher charlize theron first role 
 know movie isnt good highlight brawl two women 
even gorgeous 
 will give writers credit fairly clever ways managed intersect lives group characters otherwise never interacted 
 marveling ingenuity far cry actually enjoying result 
 characters respective stories fairly interesting inevitably brought intersect half characters really cared absolutely nothing 
 put number half story half characters movie particularly interesting otherwise enjoyable watch 
 sort movie huge fan one cast members rent even prepare disappointment 
 even charlize theron naked get sit movie 
 least anyway
