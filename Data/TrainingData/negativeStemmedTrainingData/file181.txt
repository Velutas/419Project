 goodbye lover sat shelf almost year since lukewarm reception cannes film festival last may one look will tell 
 mess 
 thats way ellen degeneres shows 
 film one torrid doubleindemnity crime stories case required services three screenwriters 
 suspect one wrote sexy thriller one wrote murder mystery one wrote comedy director roland joff tried piece together editing room scratching head bewilderment 
 didnt laugh ellen degeneres much think supposed 
degeneres horrible character even worse toughtalking vulgar cop bad wardrobe bad hair 
either degeneres wearing wigas actors appear beor doesnt yet enough clout secure hairstylist 
every single word mouth supposed racy hip incessant wisecracking poorlywritten merely stupid 
 reaction brutal killing jogger least died healthy 
 thats one wittier asides 
degeneres sgt 
rita pompano called investigate allegedly accidental death wait 
 give away much plot ruin film little going outside numbing plot twists multiple triplecrosses 
 best described way 
sultry sexpotreal estate agent sandra dunmore patricia arquette married jake creative yet unfocused alcoholic advertising rep played dermot mulroney 
sandra likes act deepseated sexual fantasies jakes brother ben suaveasever don johnson likes help 
ben also coming petite mousy coworker peggy blaine marylouise parker someone somewhere planning cash huge life insurance policy 
 film ripe cheating lovers cheating back 
although genuine surprises plot twists get contrived quickly 
probably around time degeneres gumcracking gumshoe appears 
 least former ellen star going something little different 
arquette turns yet another stilettoheeled platinum blonde bombshell roles see lost highway true romance quoting embarrassing lines like im wearing underwear 
 hope got paid lot money 
heres example films flatout stupidity 
sandra purchases used car disguises red wig prior stalking two films duplicitous lovers 
 drives motorbiking couple cliff blaring favorite sound music car stereo intent identifying hapless victims 
 point wig car 
 sound music stuff might reference wizard oz allusions david lynchs wild heart joff must forgotten wild heart despicable movie 
 hard believe goodbye lover directed person made killing fields mission 
 however hard see sat shelf long 
 stayed
