yes despite third sequel successful original movie latest highlander doesnt seem anything going 
oh stinky movie let count thee ways 
plot understood really bad highlander dude comes present looking whack nice highlander dudes order gain power become mightiest immortal 
something along lines 
critique complete utter mess 
disjointed incoherent boring corny filled bad dialogue 
thats just first thirty minutes 
 film doesnt seem know 
 confusing anyone doesnt know series include group apparently idiotic know series include diehard highlander fan arrow group 
 film doesnt explain anything 
just goes one inexplicable situation another

confused yet 
 basically stopped giving crap anyone film realized neither writer director interested presenting kind semblance story 
random swordplay mad maxlike dudes showing motorcycles s 
 present time
