 movie based wildly popular videogame series name 
 film game spinoff cartoons ok 
 idea movie insane 
 animated done 
instead people best can talented cast 
yet still fails 
 plot completely different games plot im complaining 
 story involves mario bros plumbing business brooklyn compete rival company 
eventually find construction site nemesis happens enviromentally unsafe 
 due luigis john leguizamo girlfriend princess daisy go investigate 
 get transported blade runneresque world lead king koopa dennis hopper 
somehow plot dealing dinosaurs mutated transported alternate futuristic megacity jumbles 
 plot fine better movie deserves 
 acting ok 
 seems visual film 
 special effects good especially robotic yoshi 
however film drags fun 
 leaves open sequel probably wont ever made 
 movie begins sort promising ends leaving weird taste mouth 
 want watch sort odd movie starring excellent dennis hopper watch super mario bros 
 movie

 definitely better 
 
street fighter movie starring raul julia jean claude vandamme 
 movie based series never ending sequels game called street fighter characters game reasonable plot 
 like movie

raul julia good job considering final film 
 game nonstop fighting sequences movie hodgepodge action scenes flashy sets costumes trying show plot time 
 work 
sort 
 plot involves evil shadowloo organization run m bison raul julia 
guile jean claude vandamme takes troops attack bisons main base attempt liberate innocent villages taken 
 short amount time movie introduces several characters well 
 catches attention 
 ultimately seems like showcase fans game can point things like theres chun li 
 look fireball ryu vega 
 hits bases presenting characters plot good sets goes 
 movie needed action first place 
 action scenes short exciting 
 like lighthearted action flicks liked game watch one 
 even worth watching want see raul julias last performance cant get enough van damme
