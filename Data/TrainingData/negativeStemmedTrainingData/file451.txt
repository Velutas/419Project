 month ago wrote speed worst film ive ever reviewed paper 
 didnt know time id soon encounter despise batman robin just overtaken speed picture least worthy attention summer 
 directed joel schumacher now specializes batman sequels john grisham adaptations isnt good either b r one long excuse taco bell promotion 
 plot mr freeze poison ivy uma thurman planning take gotham city vorld oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states weighted repetitive asides nature trust partnership blah blah blah 
 morals point filmtopping bloated confusing action scene next one 
 garish art direction overlit cinematography make picture oddly comparable trashy showgirls 
since gotham city become giant las vegas hotel 
 george clooney comes top underplays nicely pretends like hes real movie
