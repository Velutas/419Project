 austin powers spy shagged just half original zany silly totally enjoyable predecessor easily one summers biggest pleasures 
 
 fact spy shagged exact opposite original instead refreshing audience one clever parody another filmmakers bombard us usedup tired jokes taken directly first one 
take scene austin powers played mike myers fraction giddy enthusiasm displayed previously confronts henchmen side cliff 
 pushed ravine bad guy course assumed dead 
 suddenly hear pleading voice coming hes injured 
 similar scene played well original international man mystery insulted 
 filmmakers really believe audience laugh ripoff 
apparently overestimated intelligence average moviegoer considering film pulled million domestic theatrical grosses alone 
 hear sound franchise heading way 
 said though still deny film merits 
 basic plot delightfully silly enough sustain interest somewhat dr evil mike myers second three roles constructed time machine goes back year attempt snatch austin powers mojo dont just love word 
whilst cryogenically frozen 
 austin gets wind great intro explaining absence elizabeth hurleys vanessa kensington travels back time reclaim sexual drive accompanied hottotrot felicity shagwell played heather graham 
 sounds stupid know movie starts make kind weird offthewall sense worked 
 theres minime verne troyer 
petite clone myers dr evil exactly size 
troyers persona alone gains film extra halfstar contributing one particularly hilarious scene attempts nibble minimr 
bigglesworth 
just try ignore fact make dr evils height rise just feet 
 matter 
however four hearty laughs throughout entire hour half notable now infamous tent scene just isnt enough warrant even minor recommendation 
 fact austin powers just kill secret agent powers put emphasis dr evil minime 
unconventional yes theres denying itd make better movie
