 theres one thing just cant stand film oozes sentimentality 
heres note film makers films effective emotions characters speak 
swelling saddening music good way tell us people film unhappy situation hopeless 
alas giant film uses manipulative sentimentality frequently high intensity forgot watched ways getting audience members choked 
 reminded wasnt choked even slightest bit moved matter 
 giant forced contrived conspicuously uncute detest word cute ive chosen use makers clearly wanted create cute film 
 takes premise might interesting liked preview bogs endless plot turns cliches intended get kind easy emotional rise audience 
maybe will work people 
 didnt work 
billy crystal plays sam cayman agent beginning film romania 
hes romania kid actor made famous film 
 screenplay romania can get fired get car accident get saved enormous individual stands almost eight feet tall 
 name max gheorghe muresan sam thinks hed great movie star size 
subplots follows sam son wife kathleen quinlan hes never around move chicago 
max love woman named lilianna moved away romania twenty years film begins 
sam convinces max go back america can make lots money various subplots can resolved 
sam broke 
max dying 
pass kleenex 
 giant comedy moderately funny 
 moments best features steven seagal making fun 
 one great scene sam gets son phone talk seagal course son doesnt believe hes actually speaking seagal goes bad actor quote line like probably lose effect 
crystal always entertaining good lines subtle throwaways many will miss entirely often however hes countered slew jokes arent funny cause involuntary rolling eyes 
muresan kind fun watch just cant act well 
quinlan hand great actress needs get role shows talents 
 underused last year event horizon breakdown least films moments show us stuff 
 best thing gets fake romanian accent 
 disappointing ingredients create film much running time simply mediocre 
 giant lumbers inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann great job directing underrated hudson hawk scriptwriter david seltzer pile every cliche imaginable one intended specifically pull heartstrings 
sams multiple engagements family completely hackneyed main character healthy relationship family 
later turns entire story supposed great big metaphor signifying sams reunion family 
 people might think sam max towards end valiant thing morality problems apologize vague 
 icky 
 drips gooey wannabe human emotions 
 giant straightforward funny family film 
 importantly moving level far deeper 
instead complicated overlong underengaging film elicits laughs strives superficial tears 
 since left feeling completely unmoved stand position sentimentality evil will ultimately destroy world
