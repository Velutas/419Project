can odonnell carry weight film shoulders 
perhaps found proper vehicle 
 bachelor falls far short requirements 
 actor just cant register pathetic screenplay guiding light success 
 instances adorable humor aside becomes apparent one save festering mess bachelor 
odonnell plays jimmie hopeless romantic late twenties whos progressing serious relationship anne renee zellweger 
jimmie takes anne dinner restaurant specifically used proposals attempts ask hand marriage

ustinov enjoyable cranky grandfather figure james cromwell sincere effective wise priest dragged jimmies marital adventures 
 now cons approach may interesting trying oldfashioned method director gary sinyor gives film synthetic feel 
 characters drawn obvious broad strokes plot bogged everything humanly imaginable 
yes bachelor far frustrating cute 
 screenplay lamely written subject matter poorly conceived 
 considerable charm two leads thoughtlessly wasted along whatever promise film initially contained 
potential goes window early suit sinyors colorful approach minute hapless drivel seems accustomed directors wishes 
 bachelor becomes lost without homing beacon save
