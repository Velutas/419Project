michael crichton long career writing novels many science fiction 
 profitable film adaptation novel adaptation michael crichton science fiction novel 
 logic film industry good way make profitable film make bigbudget adaptation another crichton science fiction novel 
congo failed afraid sphere probably going fare whole lot better 
 little better just okay novel makes film even good 
 film expensive one hundred million dollars long minutes terrific cast including dustin hoffman samuel l jackson sharon stone little really original less exciting 
several years ago dr norman goodman played dustin hoffman asked write set procedures government follow alien entity actually encountered 
 plan wrote semiserious explicitly define team experts investigate alien 
now team assembled mysterious team leader named barnes peter coyote study spacecraft almost half mile length apparently dropped pacific ocean early s 
suddenly normans less serious procedure become action plan dealing real alien spacecraft 
included team investigate mathematician harry adams samuel l jackson biologist beth halperin sharon stone astrophysicist ted fielding liev schreiber 
together travel deep pacific spaceship understand secrets 
one major secret meaning huge sphere goldtoned liquid metal heart spaceship 
 disappointing film really effective performances 
director barry levinson best good actors rather good special effects 
 problem making bigbudget science fiction film 
 effects intriguing effect shows outline radar screen 
 technique suggest rather show let actors viewers imagination carry film robert wise haunting 
 reasonable approach lowbudget film 
 requires creating much atmosphere levinson can manage muster 
 requires actors give really compelling performances simply put dont 
hoffmans acting seems muted 
jackson seems laid back 
 feel characters get inside heads 
levinson paid big bucks actors really get price performance 
 queen latifah minor functionary expedition anybodys guess 
cast unknowns delivered much emotional impact fraction price 
look much powerful film like alien moderate actors 
 science fiction spectaculars days secondtier actors firsttier special effects 
levinson tries secondtier effects firsttier actors never makes exchange pay viewer 
perhaps scifi spectaculars just actors medium 
 result gets scale scale
