capsule hamhanded overunderwritten morality play masquerading entertainment muddled doesnt even know really advocating anything 
 time kill hailed best grisham adaptations easy see presents strong almost rancorously story full good actors samuel l jackson matthew mcconaughey sandra bullock kevin spacey charles dutton ostensibly important social issue tangling 
 however good movie reasons ive listed something 
right beginning movie deadset stacking deck thoroughly unrepentantly possible 
 pair redneck whites boozed drugged minds kidnap young black girl abuse rape horribly leave dead 
 arrest father jackson takes assault rifle guns way trial 
mcconaughey drafted lawyer rest somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics 
 acting quite given cast 
sandra bullock good actress serious one looks clueless spaceys accent switches random hes given totally thankless role play well role without iota depth mcconaugheys role stamped cardboard back cereal box 
 memorable role donald sutherlands bit part 
 always consider index movies desperation able present shocking outlandish events somehow generate ounce impact 
 one scene riot outside courtroom created incredible tension winds playing like textbook exercise deploy scene like 
 movie doesnt know really cant generate genuine tension artifically inject tension clumsy plotting 
one ways throwing whole subplot bunch vicious kkk crossburners tidied neatly borders nihilistic 
 reminded despicable betrayed tried tart fundamentally empty story injecting vile graphic acts racism little attentiongetter 
 movie immolates enormous amount potential making critical mistakes 
first jackson character hard judge theres tension dilemma 
hes selfadmittedly guilty sent jail matter moral crusade 
 old saw court land convict white supposed underlying theme movie never developed organic component story 
 just sort floats around top movie grinds away furiously plot mechanics 
another mistake motivational logic two white thugs arraigned first maybe tried dismissed lack evidence say much less empathy jacksons character 
im probably supposed think just daughter raped automatically supposed feel empathy thats precisely kind facile thinking makes real justice impossible 
 see virgin spring note 
 jacksons character simply insane 
 prospect isnt given terribly serious treatment either 
one aggravating things coutroom movies little seem know law works lawyers get information 
mcconaugheys character makes important slipup late movie one witnesses turns convicted capital offense 
 prosecution get information 
 come didnt get 
 whole way questions get handled symptomatic movies way dealing complex legal moral questions cheap screenwriterly slambang fashion 
 biggest problem movie isnt jacksons character dilemma case frequently interesting despite porcine writing direction characters 
 ultimately anything except stupid geareddown plot inches onwards one unremarkable scene another towards totally contrived ending 
 two half hours movie overlong drastically overwritten theres endless stuff things ultimately add nothing writing material really matter 
 handwaving 
 closing argument also sneaky underhanded underscored suspicion movie manipulative unfair 
 easy make movie something 
 day saw kurosawas phenomenal rashomon movie really way people deal truth reality dont 
 time kill empty ponderous movie ive seen long time
