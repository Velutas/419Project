 seeing blaze driving miss daisy ready mindless funoh maybe something like tango cash 
maybe 
mindless fun one thing braindead slop another matter altogether 
tango cash lowest common denominator written 
 movie stars sylvester stallone kurt russell rival undercover cops l russell plays cash reckless slob dresses jeans tee shirts 
stallone plays tango wealthy investor works force strictly thrill doesnt need money 
 effort change image stallone goes yuppie gq look film wearing spectacles three piece suits 
 two detectives reluctantly become partners framed murder break prison clear names 
tango cash unbearably noisy 
 starters theres harold faltermeyers annoying synthesized score gets old four notes 
 make matters worse filmmakers seem think comes loud explosions screeching cars merrier 
 fact movie begins one two car chases 
theres nothing like good old car chase introduce characters movie 
screenwriter randy feldmans brain must gone mush watching many cop shows tv 
 shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything everything movie going stallones efforts convince tango intellectual 
 movie iq level amoeba even great actor going trouble looking intelligentand stallone lawrence olivier 
 hard imagine anyone reading feldmans script thinking want movie 
 films plot doesnt one original bone body andagainyou point finger screenwriting 
feldmans story line succumbs every crime thriller cliche book making tango cash altogether generic predictable 
 simply called action movie 
every character every twist turn stolen television movies 
adding insult injury tango cash believable road runner cartoon 
action movies dont realistic absorb enough youre thinking lack realism 
 artistic aspect tango cash cinematography 
 spectacular shots especially rainy nighttime prison break tango cash slide safety electrical wires 
 films main draw chemistry stallone russell 
unfortunately relationship rarely progresses past macho competition endlessly bicker packs meat pants 
 dialogue consists nothing oneliners consequently attempts character development embarrassing 
 shame workable screenplay russell stallone turned tango cash charming lethal weaponesque adventure 
tango cash tries maintain light tone laugh every five minutes 
seeing russell drag movies funniest moment probably already seen commercials 
furthermore light tone sit well relentlessly brutal violence 
machine guns torture generally dont mix well comedy 
jack palance appears tango cash best playing sleazy conniving villain 
 character however runofthemill except strange obsession mice 
like many movie villains palance likes play games 
 fact sets ridiculously elaborate trap tango cash trap sends two detectives prison can beaten electrocuted meanies boiler room 
 wonder palance doesnt just shoot detectives head 
 story crumble characters anything intelligent 
teri hatcher plays stallones sister russells loveinterest just pretty can 
 regrettably hatchers acting par exceptional beauty 
every time opens mouth cringe corny dialogue atrocious acting always fatal combination 
theres really little anything recommend film 
 point tango definitely isnt worth penny cashso dont bother
