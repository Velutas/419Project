 production early days initial aborted prerelease publicity hard rain bore appropriate moniker flood 
ultimately however paramount pictures nervous movie confused s underperforming disaster films dantes peak volcano changed title shifted release date nearly year 
 paraphrase bard swill name smell rank 
 number name changes can help picture 
 just disaster disaster 
hard rain case movie gets progressively worse every passing minute 
 best shot occurs opening credits camera pans streets byways huntingburg indiana water level slowly rises 
 community protected overworked dam evacuated rain continues pour relentlessly cloudchoked skies 
 moment downhill 
whatever initial entertainment value film possesses long since drained away halfway point 
 takes forever get end credits one longestseeming minute motion pictures recently endured 
basically hard rain one extended dull chase sequence punctuated occasional shootouts 
theres lot water broken glass gunfire explosions 
 routine uninteresting arent real characters plot occasionally makes sense 
 films conclusion preposterous almost worth watching sheer masochistic enjoyment seeing monumentally idiotic way film makers decide resolve myriad subplots floating around 
action films supposed become progressively invigorating rush towards conclusion 
graham yost writer speed hard rain surely understands principle 
unfortunately neither cinematographerturneddirector mikael salomon far place applies 
 action hard rain grows tedious repetition 
 see kinds things speedboat chases flood damage shootouts etc 
 movie constantly recycles twenty minutes worth material pad running time acceptable movie length 
 storyline gives us number paperthin characters contrived circumstances 
theres tom christian slater one dimensional action hero works security guard driving armored car full cash 
 partner charlie edward asner tvs lou grant get stuck street thats rapidly turning river 
 group men led jimmy morgan freeman arrive scene rescuers robbers 
 charlie killed shootout tom hides money runs 
 swims boats way huntingburgs roads encounters locals karen minnie driver wouldbe love interest bickering old couple richard dysart betty white hand provide comic relief easilycorrupted sheriff randy quaid whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives 
 isnt real acting film 
christian slater utters lame oneliners lot mugging camera 
tom easily one lifeless characters actor brought screen 
randy quaid sneers lot totally unconvincing 
morgan freeman minnie driver attempt give legitimate performances defeated script 
freeman one best cinematic thespians working today looks suitably embarrassed suppose everyone needs good paycheck timetotime 
following wake twister yet another natural disaster movie doesnt trust natures fury chief engine conflict 
 result saddled idiotic good guysbad guys story effectively ruins potential flood tale 
titanic proved can wealth drama movie everything goes water 
hard rain successfully demonstrates opposite equally possible 
thus far year hollywood already subjected us unique brand moronic mayhem fire firestorm water hard rain 
fortunately two elements left
