okay okay 
maybe wasnt mood watch mindless action movie person liked lethal weapon iii even admitting wasnt good others 
howewer latest segal picture didnt look bad since none friends go see woody allen movie even paid went see expecting mild die hard rehash 
boy wrong 
 first half movie already assaulted segals acting simply wooden like wall gratuitous violence incredible plot sexist even gratuitous nudity bad lines obviously meant jokes 
 end obvious hundreds navy men match thirty armed special forces soldiers 
 movie segal appear worried undecided much increasing unexistent suspense 
 course movies like must sidekick love interest 
 one given two one package form playboy model movie functions supposed comic relief way extremely stupid unfunny lines watering eyes look away every time something bad happens movie 
oh course appears naked waist course segal kisses end development relationship even seem interested 
 never seen little chemistry two people movie 
often villain saves movie unfortunately villains cartoonish stupid unfunny unmenacing 
 many movies psycho exspecial forces bad guys 
 many 
 able predict action throughout movie including moment sidekick saves hero certain death scene bad guy can kill hero proceeds explain plan scene shown heros superiors stupid scene bad guy loses gun fight hero hand hand etc 
simply said moviemaking numbers boring potentially offensive going lowest common denominator audience 
 recommendation go see bring watch 
youll looking movie 
 
rent die hard 
read book 
stare sky 
 waste time worthless piece celluloid 
 real sad thing lot movies rather seen dragged friends way liked movie halfheartedly 
 probably like wrestling
