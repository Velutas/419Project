 happy bastards quick movie review 
holy man 
 like holy crap 
 film stars eddie murphy mysticalish figure named g strange journey sort comes across two network execs jeff goldblum kelly preston flat tire hands 
somehow ends car channel lineup infomercial programs featuring likes betty white morgan fairchild slew celebrities nameless figures 
 seems hit stride speaking life instead somehow boosting sales 
 point movie course morality comes play particularly goldblum suddenly feels can market magical g megabucks get good boss robert loggia 
 doesnt take long movie unfold sappy mush realizations taking place left right poor plot points 
 real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchilds face seems interest movie 
murphy lends nothing character poor goldblum looks hed rather someplace else 
 may argue movie message came across probably get entertainment watching informercial guy question mark coat 
 least something us laught
