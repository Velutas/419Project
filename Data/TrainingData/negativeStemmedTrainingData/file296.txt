 first saw preview cruel intentions turned friend said dangerous liaisons kids 
 clear film obvious chunk plagiarized nonsense owing everything stephen frears masterpiece 
imagine surprise see writerdirector roger kumble given credit source material choderlos de laclos recognized novel les liaisons dangereuses opening credits 
 impressed 
 fact much impressed recognition actual film appalling excuse movie 
 kiddieporn hackwork complete earthy sextalk fullyclothed handjobs 
 suppose kind movie inevitable teen highschool angst movies coming certainly room pretentious laughable movie bunch teenagers think theyre smarter beautiful people earth combined 
cruel intentions mess every possible way fails primarily way expected hated characters hate everything 
 also hate ryan phillippe perhaps opinion objective 
phillippe plays check name sebastian valmont 
wow 
isnt memorable name 
 just say 
sebastian valmont 
 kind rolls tongue spirit phrases like sanguine vapors velvet sandwich 
sebastian valmont coolest guy ever walked earth woman cant material object reach 
 money sex fingertips 
 luckily parents never enter life world cruel intentions adults dont really exist 
 ones irritating 
sebastian valmont lives stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar bitchqueen universe also woman every man wants 
since two rich kids bored thing can challenge meaningless sexual liaisons 
kathryn wants sebastian valmont devirginize cecile caldwell selma blair naive dorkchick somehow wronged kathryn 
 easy sebastian valmont wants nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon paradigm chastity beauty 
 sebastian valmont kathryn make deal explicit state 
 dear god 
 sebastian valmont actually begins fall poor annette hargrove 
dangerous liaisons great movie characters believable masterful acting 
cruel intentions bad many reasons lacks believable characters masterful acting 
kathryn merteuil simply hateful witch girl loathsome probably enjoy pouring hot lead 
 supposed mean glenn close gave character depth dangerous liaisons 
gellar aesthetically pleasing onedimensional utterly repulsive 
witherspoon truly beautiful face character isnt moral staple shes supposed sure wont sex shes love really moral issue things last scenes little reprehensible 
 cant forget mr phillippe continues exceed expectations impenetrable invulnerable blandness 
 give credit say fact manage change facial expression three times course cruel intentions 
 theres one point film shouts thereby defeating hypothesis vocally monotone 
true bad doesnt help character work 
kumble drained interesting aspects character leaving us sexcrazed lunatic supposed sympathetic falls love moral flower shuns wicked bitch 
 film fails every way 
first nobody talks like 
even intellectuals know dont bother kind pointless pretentious yammering 
 movie looks like might play laughs ends taking seriously theres way can join 
cruel intentions also manages come softporn one scene 
earlier mentioned fullyclothed handjob occurs kathryn sebastian valmont intended hateful point movie 
 hate whats point extended sex scene 
titillation course 
 cant even work pretense meaningful love scene hate characters 
 interesting note parallels cruel intentions dangerous liaisons 
kumble clearly familiar earlier film many scenes similar tone moments frears film kumble imitates almost completely last scene spoiler warning antagonist humiliated front peers 
 kids dont act like 
nobody acts like 
 translation roger kumble forgot character development sympathy pretty crucial elements 
 result picture confounding badness kiddieporn mess thinks really deep profound 
ill give cruel intentions credit realizing influences doesnt change fact awful
