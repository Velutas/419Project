 youve run old tv shows turn movies guess try video games 
 go see mortal kombat annihilation 
 quest seek answer query may prove better movie one just saw 
 film bunch fighting yelling special effects bad acting set oppressive techno music soundtrack 
 plot fairly simple portal opened world outworld allowing evil forces commanded shao kahn brian thompson wreak havoc attempt destroy humanity 
 good guys led sorcerer rayden james remar human mortal liu kang robin shou must take fight outworld fate worlds will determined 
heres catch must reunite princess katana talia soto whos good side resurrected mother queen sindel musetta vander whos bad side love will close portal ensure humanitys safety another generation 
 supposed work still idea liked katanas line knew love keep us together since captain tennille song ran head got good laugh 
 seriously stupid things movie 
take example transportation system utilizes inner winds generated earths magma flows 
 get metal ball transports underground tunnels really fast 
 fast 
 katana says will moving fast will moving 
 
later sonya blade sandra hess goes find jax lynn red williams otherwise known saber tvs american gladiators medical research facility island oahu 
 know went 
theres sign facilitys perimeter fence reads medical research facility oahu hawaii 
remember caption actual sign 
 guess location medical researchers keep forgetting 
theres lot major flipping action 
 first encounter good evil shows kahn rayden swiftly arching though air toward one another 
 land immediately get fighting 
 one land first catch guard 
 collide midair 
 apparently flip toward can talk without yell far away 
 need metal balls travel 
everyone just flipped point point b 
 admit fight scenes pretty good although can tell heavily enhanced digital effects fly wires allowing characters surpass limits human body laws physics 
 movies thrills derived scenes audience responses visceral level someone gets trashed really badly 
 ouch common expletive heard screened one 
 tell filmmakers knew advance fights plot main draw since dialog apparently film just get one fight next 
 seems thats movie 
maybe 
 mentioned acting bad 
theres one solid performance film although williams jax pretty funny 
 fight sonya one bad guys degenerates female mud wrestling jax says look good mud 
 really 
remar plays rayden inconsistency makes hard take character seriously shou relatively emotionless liu kang 
brian thompson played good guys bad guys even alien tvs xfiles always musclebound behemoth average evil demigod scripts fault doesnt anything original say 
 one really impressive thing movie one swear word whole hour half 
another thing noted punching kicking blood appears one scene 
 mortal kombat annihilation loud violent shallow marketed toward kids 
hey just like video game
