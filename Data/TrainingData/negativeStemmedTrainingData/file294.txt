alexander dumas three musketeers one oftenadapted literary works good reason swashbuckler legend rather just story 
perhaps musketeer new film reimagines novel spirit style matrix one adaptation many 
 just awful spiritless silly unforgivably boring transforming timeless classic mishmash oldastime clich s incoherent repetitive action sequences 
 time dartagnan played calvin klein model justin chambers cant even pronounce characters name 
 boy watched father get killed febre tim roth lackey powerhungry cardinal richelieu 
 vowed vengeance 
 undergoing intense training expert swordsman goes looking enemy 
 quest embroils struggle control highest levels french government 
 royal musketeers lost gusto jobs taken cardinals guards 
 loyal swashbuckers remain among athos portos figureheads movie 
together dartagnan fight extricate queen catherine deneuve traps febre richelieu trying plant 
oh afterthought dartagnan falls love poor maid local inn mena suvari 
just thought id mention 
now look dont know whose idea whoever responsible deserves severe tonguelashing 
 nothing modernizing classic works literature least can inspire viewers actually read book films dull positive side effects 
director peter hyams known masterpieces modern cinema timecop end days jettisoned everything great dumas masterwork sense excitement cause camaraderie 
instead get impressively choreographed somehow vacuous uninvolving action sequences emerge emptiness lead nothing 
 musketeers finally get holler one one sworn dumas rolling grave felt 
maybe reason utter lack suspense hyamss tone unreasonably dark brooding consider readers digest condensed version story gives us 
 though anything may construed fun purposely expunged production 
 joylessness proceedings oppressively shady lighting mechanical fight scenes can felt every frame 
chambers cant act suvari roth deneuve can arent given chance 
 push comes shove use stunt doubles distractingly obvious though least roth gets play villain without wear ape suit 
 movies seem sloppy careless clearly made quick buck 
 musketeer get sense meticulously crafted awful 
 film intricate stylish precise hitting wrong note every single time
