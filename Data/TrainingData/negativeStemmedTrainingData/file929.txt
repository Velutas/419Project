martial arts master steven seagal mention director built career playing allegedly fictitious martial arts superman never gets hurt fights talks hushed tone squints sign danger 
hes also consistent individual hollywood today since movies suck 
 basically represent egotisitical tendencies art martial art 
im sure guys good seems like nice guy talk shows although tad haughty movies makes guy basically indestructable maybe wounded supposedly mortally comes back vengeance goes buddha baddies asses although kinda liked siege 
 course one change message drilled mind 
course blows lot stuff kills bunch people 
 watch crap 
 usually dont 
 will never can hold will never pay see mans movies unless unless hes supporting role e 
 executive decision id definitely pay dies e 
 executive decision 
 one special place heart 
 doesnt mean good even liked 
 last movie watched deceased uncle one hell time ripping apart la mystery science theatre couple years heard mystery science theatre 
 one seagal plays worker mining factory set alaska run greasedup typical shallow villain time played oscarwinner give movie clout michael caine 
 seems caine wants something oil factory includes dumping oil inuit land 
around minute point seagal speaks seems typical speech vain entrepeneurs new fire another message film caine bumped 
 
seagal rescued inuits falls love one played joan chen can act hypothetically reason 
one caines cliched henchmen played lot overacting john c mcginley shoots cheif inuit clan chen seagal go voyage take oil factory literally 
 course 
 one point seagal gives wonderfully hysterical speech doesnt options blow stuff 
 even goes far say dont want kill someone breath asks guy arsenal 
 problem violence 
im huge john woo fan paints films suspense skill style depth characterization just plain cool violence 
 films seagal suspense mainly consists baddie attacking stupidly either wounding killing 
 points use cliche talking villain villain advantage can shoot seagal begins talking either telling big secret plan saying corny line seagal says something hokey back enough time devise way away 
 okay suspense didnt take seriously like case summers con air 
 seagal serious skill course message 
 wouldnt mind message film way present evidence 
 seagal idea present film message subtle pounded viewers mind 
 villain totally shallow cartoonish thus cant take motives seriously seagal talks kind environment also goes ahead blows square mile rig kills workers just job 
 end spends good minutes giving speech just case didnt get message trailers 
 seagal doesnt realize one takes films seriously although maybe couple message redundant doesnt comfortably fit film filled brim hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama characters much emotional depth petri dish 
 far seagal acting hes rather boring 
 squints kills 
period 
nothing else 
oh yeah theres corny oneliners im gonna reach touch someone 
 course hes star supposed root makes villains unbelievably stupid bunch jerks 
michael caine whos great actor just supposed yell look cold 
 well guess alfie 
 coure one expecting caliber performance 
 big henchman john c mcginley kinda boring well horrible 
 even get small performance god drill sergeants celluloid r lee ermey full metal jacket hired assasin squad leader gets say obligatory speech dangerous seagal just movie trailers seagals ego 
 also look billy bob thornton one ermeys assasins 
anyway conclude judge one seagals movies judge except siege executive decision though latter really seagal movie 
 formula action villain plot one message makes excrucitating watch 
 mean rent dont reccomend make sure just skip last minutes 
 put seagal creating film bad last film viewed uncle pleasurable one 
 extra star fun watch mock
