conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers childrens items begin dramatically escalate price twentyfive thirty years item made 
thats kids time jobs disposable income desire revisit awe wonderment childhood disappeared lives 
check prices toys late sixties youll find yogi bear lunch boxes demanding big bucks 
theres heavy nostalgia nowadays late sixties early seventies nowhere apparent big screen 
boomers now mostly forties fifties lived workaday world long time 
theyd like recapture fun remember days yore 
hollywood seems eager churn product help 
directors zealous put stamp icons time 
 part theyre messing 
 mission impossible lost space godzilla zorro 
none successfully capture originals 
none even good films 
 can now add avengers list 
 british television series began 
super secret agent john steed thenpatrick macnee third partner emma peel thendiana rigg pair american audience fell 
surrealistic witty series fit mood times 
 leatherclad rigg probably didnt hurt ratings either 
 coincidence cant pronounce characters name without appeal 
now nineties 
steed nowralph fiennes peel nowuma thurman battling evil genius sir august de wynter sean connery screwing englands weather 
thats much plot 
theres footage lot things either dont make sense make even less sense 
 get betrayal unknown reason 
evil clones appear vanish connection film 
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps machine guns belly come nowhere good reason 
theres high tech hot air balloon idea anyones 
 spy agency run man called mother wheelchair woman named father blind 
least scenes 
theres probably reason well never know 
macnee makes appearance sorts 
 voice invisible man whose character goes nowhere scene nothing 
 group villains sits around table clad huge pastelcolored teddy bear outfits 
 first humorous watch teddies waddle around becomes goofy 
 movie medley clutter confusion wrong decisions around every corner 
 feels like major portions film missing 
 storyline jumps rather flows 
reportedly film recut several times 
 one times whole less sum parts especially since parts appear missing 
theres one good point peel running one room another house designed escher 
 effects secondrate 
 weather threat old hat scenes huge tornadoes 
thurman almost makes adequate emma peel doesnt work 
 looks good dresses right fetish outfits theres spark 
fiennes fares even less well 
macnees steed witty man world sense humor 
fiennes agent comes across dour kid grownup clothes never home town 
even connery one greatest living actors doesnt much presence outside fiery scenes 
 action scenes difficult follow 
director jeremiah chechik responsible atrocious remake diabolique somehow manages put camera exactly shouldnt 
things happen people move around even utmost effort able care scenes bewildering 
 primary allure original interaction two leads 
witty banter underplayed sexual tension winning combination 
admittedly humorous sexual puns film theres chemistry repartee anything clever 
one emma peels first lines dialog rules made broken 
 doesnt get better 
advance word alone enough scare anyone 
 release date changed several times 
connery refuses promote film 
 screening critics may good choice warner brothers 
 least way get something audience first weekend news gets 
admittedly havent seen episode television series couple decades 
 guess severely dated now 
 matter antiquated might theres doubt holds better film first viewing 
theres reason waste part last days summer inside watching movie 
 reason
