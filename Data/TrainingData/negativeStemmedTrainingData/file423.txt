 spawn may somewhat older film 
 fact will probably video anyone hasnt seen will finally get see see 
 managed catch made way theaters world rentals god forbid video cassette purchasing 
 wasnt worst film year means 
 isnt even top worst films year 
 manage top bottom five bottom ten simpler terms means comes number worst list 
 reason doesnt come lower thanks special effects might actually best year 
performances however either wooden part unforgivingly campy 
 fact film shows signs attempting avoid campiness 
even editing seemed boast campy quality 
 dont know explain one wasnt exactly choppy something seemed 
 
 
well annoyingly unprofessional 
john leguizamo almost makes clown quite 
 character provides audience laughs can honestly called intentional 
 main problem found spawn films wind worst lists just plain boring 
 wouldnt even say climax film 
sure big battle scene end excitement felt movie might nearing conclusion 
never soon movie conclude simple disappointing way 
even though one shorter movies ive seen year one definitely want subject sitting thru 
like said special effects reason film sense pride matter small 
 impressed opening sequence long didnt allow melodramatic voiceover lobotomizing editing get 
 batman nothing spectacular visuals spawns outfit created 
 even effects got tiresome final scenes looked quite bit like modern video game 
 knows spawn video game wasnt part plan beginning 
keeping mind film based comic book makes somewhat approachable small amount makes cheeziness 
 none movies saving graces can make something id recommend seeing matter price admission 
 movie definitely young children shouldnt really problem seeing teenagers anyone likely find appealing 
 really want catch movie many better ones matter tastes might 
trust 
 spawn little offer even avid moviegoers
