 time dennis quaid ostensible star switchback makes first appearance minute mark may find wondering bothered 
 writerdirector jeb stuart already set fairly promising pair parallel story lines 
 first finds amarillo texas sheriff buck olmstead r lee ermey facing hotlycontested election battle just brutal double homicide discovered motel jurisdiction 
 olmstead begins investigation also meet two men come prime suspects 
lane dixon jared leto enigmatic young hitchhiker bob goodall danny glover jovial motorist offers lane ride texas utah destination 
 necessary conflicts seem place internal struggle olmstead clash good politics good police work external struggle one two travelers eventually becomes villain others protagonist 
 quaid shows grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse 
lacrosse certain amarillo murders work serial killer tracking nearly two years 
hes supposed tracking according bureau theyve got man lacrosse important reason believing otherwise 
two months earlier lacrosses son kidnapped killer boy yet turn anywhere 
lacrosse knows killers work knows man still somewhere trying continue game 
 wouldnt fair reduce everything thats wrong switchback quaids presence pretty good place start 
theres reason lacrosse feels like intruder narrative instead vital center dramatic actor dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression one vocal intonation 
 can tell lacrosse determined face perpetual tightjawed sourpuss pucker can tell hes grim every word comes eastwoodesque rasp 
 flexible performer might given weight character pulling audience haunted intensity making switchback film 
quaid merely looks annoyed slightly constipated 
 tough become emotionally invested characters turmoil looks like really needs big bowl bran flakes 
even without quaid doesnt appear switchback stayed course 
 early scenes leto glover lively energy building curiosity man taciturn kid gregarious benefactor real threat 
unfortunately stuart tips hand far early game pitch individual performances facts chooses reveal 
 mystery killers identity dispatched interaction leto glover becomes stale predictable 
 fact stale predictable describes direction switchback takes general falling back fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping nowhere climactic fistfight board freight train edgy law enforcement agents 
 bad stuart wasnt willing spend time sheriff olmstead far away interesting appealing character film 
played atypical restraint r lee ermey hes wonderful unconventional hero seems genuinely comfortable accepting consequences acting convictions 
 film focusing olmstead signaled filmmaker willing take risks casting storytelling 
instead stuart places trust name star cant carry material 
maybe next time hell throw away one crucial page script one grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto scene muck perfectly good story
