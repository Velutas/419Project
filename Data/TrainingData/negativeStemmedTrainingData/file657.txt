 seemed like perfect concept 
 better farrelly brothers famous writing directing comedies offensive subject matter make movie guy split personality 
 exactly sort thing brothers relish poking fun something serious case mental illness throwing care wind get laugh 
jim carreys signed 
even better 
 national alliance mentally ill even helped levying complaints brothers new film opening claiming misrepresenting condition split personality labeling incorrectly schizophrenia forth 
 protest seemed like just sort thing course add fuel farrelly brothers fire proving people just couldnt take joke farrellys helping enlightened viewers yet another dose brilliantly subversive comedy 
yes seemed perfect one thing went wrong movie isnt funny 
 lack trying 
 farrellys utilize irene highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man dumped wife midget limo driver decides bury aggressive feelings deep inside never release 
 course means neighbors exploit entirely tooforgiving nature making job rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult 
soon enough charlies repressed aggression manifests second independent personality named hank deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid taking assertive actions predecessor unable muster 
 guy isnt crashing car wall barber shop hes insulted holding little girls head underwater refused stop jumproping street 
 things start getting lost complicated plot farrellys ever attempted film runs tracks 
 suggested isnt problem farrelly brothers brand humor doesnt require plot work 
theyre wrong course plot greatly instrumental building kind rollicking comic energy infused farrellys last effort s theres something mary 
 s outside providence technically earlier project 
 brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely contained outrageous gags despite newsmagazine articles believe rather outrageous gags entirely unexpected 
 mary farrellys managed several times pull neat sleightofhand trick theyd thinking story going one way reveal real direction delightfully surprising fashion 
 irene contrast seems made folks looked mary saw surface grossness missing subtle machinations really made work 
 produced guys made mary irene seems like even bigger disappointment 
 brothers pile offensive humor taking shots race midgets albinos mental illness manner bathroom jokes 
 havent come way make fresh irene comes rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy 
 plot carrey forced drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger whos trouble anyone knows back new york ending thats entirely predictable getgo 
 think charlie irene will fall love 
yeah 
 farrellys introduce scores different characters none ever manage anything havent already expected matter outrageous actions might 
compared curveballs farrellys used throwing stuff almost entirely softtossed presenting obvious problem grossout humor loses shock value longer funny merely gross 
 jokes work milked effectiveness runs dry 
take example subplot involving charlies three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon 
 incongruity funny three burly black men discussing higher math ghetto language whitebread carrey mouthing said language entirely toopleasant smile face 
 end film theyre still schitck hasnt elevated another funnier level hasnt dropped either 
thats bad ceases amusing halfway 
 irene reeks wasted opportunities 
 focus people react charlies new personality charlie deals consequences hanks actions 
 doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns charlies condition early dont opportunity surprised 
 film throws looks like patented farrelly curve scene towards midway point involving albino companion charlie irene pick called appropriately whitey script doesnt go anywhere instead leaving thread twisting wind awkwardly tying climax 
jim carrey gifted comedian physically vocally hes left nothing much except contort manner similar steve martin 
 great showcase flexibility splitsecond roleshifting none terribly funny 
carrey doesnt pull stunts dont expect pull farrellys script doesnt give anything else pull situations must perform roleshifting arent set meaningful way 
perhaps carrey can take solace fact supporting actors fare better 
zellwegers irene strong female lead mary mary may part adolescent fantasy also intelligent strongwilled 
irene nothing particular film never makes clear whether shes ditzy clever neither 
 gives us nothing latch onto sane person film 
chris cooper stuck playing exactly one note corrupt fbi agent character entirely straightlaced movie like 
 like others absolutely nothing unexpected 
 viewing shapeless mess irene eventually dissolved stuck wondering whether farrellys outsmarted 
maybe kind comedy can work long audiences get wise stop shocked 
 dont believe good filmmakers find ways surprising audiences even people grown attuned style 
 farrellys indeed good smart filmmakers still think theyll rebound just fine 
even happens though ill still consider irene highcaliber misfire
