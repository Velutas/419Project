 dialogue film taken almost completely context jazzed bit make inept 
 spoken two protagonists somewhere film basically serves perfect example film especially realize exchange meant taken seriously 
mr gregg imhavingamidlifecrisis araki writer director film wants show important teenagers wants show feel horrible horrible world 
 show 
 really cheap surrealism moronic exchanges like 
oh gets better 
 similar bit dialogue said middle oh dunno fiftieth sex scene film im counting several masturbation scenes 
 one protagonists humping away top another says something along lines ever wonder life 
sorry man foreplay takes place act coitus 
 course expect film written directed guy cant even spell first name right yes know cheap joke done 
 doom generation advertised road trip movie people go around killing others attack also another teen angst film one slogans teen fourletter word hardy har har 
 film two angsty teens amy blue rose macgowan later play buxom tatum scream jordon white james duval go play randy quaids son independence day pick angsty homicidal maniac xavier red jonathan schaech go play angsty lead guitarist thing 
 way get symbolism 
red white blue 
huh 
huh go road trip three things happen order sex run weird people kill 
 film basically remix bunch far superior films 
gregg araki obviously seen films easy rider natural born killers kalifornia tries borrow elements films make something like pop culture reference guide 
 forgets films either represented something film dug deep subjects brought something make deeper 
 doom generation doesnt want just wants show everything surreal manner sole reason araki want deal kind real level 
 wants show everything weird manner forgets scenes supposed 
heres one scene earlier scene film amy jordan go quicke mart type place get food stuff 
amy smoking clerk asian man mind love racist film really tells put 
 tells fuck something note 
 points shotgun puts reluctantly 
jordan makes two hot dogs takes counter 
 cash register rings 
 oh symbolism doesnt stop 
jordan checks wallet really car 
 asks amy left wallet car well 
 clerk brings shotgun asks money 
 say dont 
 gets ready kill xavier ditched middle nowhere scene pops nowhere fights clerk ends blowing clerks head clean clean wound mind 
 head shown flying air lands fryer begins scream 
 dont really object kind sick violence scene film one reason one reason gross 
araki thinks takes everything extreme hell make kind art 
wrong 
 takes kind resistance make gore art 
 george romero made dawn dead gory flick even today control everything still able make everything sick 
 goes peter jacksons disgustingly gory dead alive features minute long fest blood guts dismemberments flesh chewing assorted stuff ending guy lawn mower strapped body taking sorts zombies 
 sick also satirical controled 
 scene like purpose film sticks everything else happens 
heres couple scenes jordan amy sex bath tub xavier watches masturbates licks semen hand xavier amy sex jordan watches window masturbates falls backwards man attacks trio stabbed crotch giant sword put just happen fast food employee stalks trio arm shot xavier various annoyances 
also look million camoes wide assortment people probably didnt really know getting signed just like peter otoole helen mirren malcolm macdowell john gielgud probably didnt signed caligula 
people indie actors parker posey nicky katt alternative rock stars skinny puppy perry farrel hollywood madam heidi fleiss christopher peter brady mcknight amanda bearse margaret cho grace screen matter seconds disappear can return annoying main plot line 
 
 can point say hey look fill blank 
wow 
gimme break 
 films meaning pretty easy detect know teens precious world horrible place two entities collide theres giant explosion horrific violence 
otherwise defined teen angst belief teenager horrible thing world bad 
look im years old 
 went brief teen angst thing curiously lasted long taste nirvana 
ive since moved dont really know life phase teen angst phase something annoyingly sophomoric ignorant film thinks theyre dealing kind serious level just beating wrong horse 
part teen experimenting testing waters 
 whining awful parents purposely feeling dispondent 
 characters film film wants show theyre great people punished world theyre teenagers try defend cant totally overcome 
 fault kill people worlds 
 really need reality check 
 world bad place teenagers can easily harmed experimenting 
 part taking everything happens learning 
 film thinks teenagers basically doomed theres nothing can 
hence title 
 bad fallacy cant even express intelligent coherent manner 
everythings overly surreal get scenes graphic violence graphic sex 
 xavier licking semen hand express teen angst 
 talking decapitated head show teens dispondent world makes way 
 film constantly go back teen angst issue film 
 araki kind competence writing direction hed show really 
 didnt want satirical approach hed show real problems world 
 still dont think doom generation incompetent every single possible level take acting 
rose macgowan horrible 
yes proved talented scream shes bad doom generation seen scream christened one worst actresses working films today 
 entire performance onenote bitchy one scene cries dead animal forced laughable 
equally bad jonathan schaech wants slacker serial killer someone doesnt remorse emotions cause kind strain 
 performance annoying hell granted better thing 
 theres james duval 
lets just say makes keanu reeves look like brando 
 kind slacker stuttering much much much worse every line says bad now deemed least talented actor world 
 seen lots bad actors james duval got worst 
 least somewhere 
heres another example bad scene youre still convinced film opens club theyre playing nine inch nails banal song heresy example lines god deadand one caresif hellill see song plays red strobe lights show patrons dancing film pans amy just standing looking dispondent 
 film closes looks right camera says fuck 
 explanation necessary 
 finally note gregg grow 
really 
move parents basement read something salinger get day job 
 dont quit
