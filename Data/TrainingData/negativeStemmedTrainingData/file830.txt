 epiphany today 
 occurred watching house haunted hill 
 follows trailer makes film advertising look like trashy stupid movie well guess 
chances truth advertising 
 bad didnt trust instincts somethingortheother possessed see movie 
 blame sudden craving scare anticipation sleepy hollow 
 dogma started late afternoon schedule 
 hour angel buffy scarier doozy tries scary shtick falls flat face 
 wish id seen halloween 
 least forgiving 
hey tis season 
 movie scary albeit confusing dizzying nauseating first soon horror got repetitive downright laughable film obviously wasnt going anywhere 
now truly appreciate films like scream halloween old hitchcock film scariness stems situations least somewhat realistic 
thats spooks people fact happen someone know 
 logical precedent situations want scare us 
sure utterly unpredictable good thats different utterly nonsensical 
hohh house haunted hill hand 
 
 
well lets just say fell chair laughing ohsocleverly revealed everyone got invited party related psycho doctors died house couple decades ago 
riiiiight 
yknow just sends chills spine 
yeah 
just like wet pants told house evil 
ooooooo 
hint blood guts work times 
sooner later people start tell just ketchup props youve got come something better 
 just many things movie weve seen inevitable plot developments strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning evil manifesting dead coming back last scare 
 predictable last 
 didnt fools just stay together one place anyways 
sheesh 
 grossed 
yes 
 get spooked times 
yes 
 
 get really disturbed 
 werent random scares reason visual effect wasnt good either trust scare film filled drab laughable dialogue 
 characters incredibly flat cliched
