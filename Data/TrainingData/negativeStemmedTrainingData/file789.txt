remember back mid s crime macabre movies rage 
 pulp fiction fargo managed get oscar nominations best picture surprisingly slew ripoffs followed years thereafter 
 fad seems comes christopher mcquarrie writing directing way gun first glance looks like another wannabes upon closer inspection doesnt look like anything comprehendable 
 crime story wrapped little world claustrophobic atmosphere film wont allow story much room expand outside handful characters somehow still manages turn simple premise something complex ridiculous 
complexity come surprise anyone whos familiar mcquarrie wrote usual suspects become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim 
 film great story well directed elaborate confusing screenplay leaves many viewers scratching heads repeated viewings 
 wonder mcquarrie really everything mapped going hollywood idea really confusing criminals cops makes fascinating 
 way gun mcquarrie seems capitalizing idea time story far less commercial shame maybe helped 
 film tells story two drifters ambition barely reason live arent hellbent death either played ryan phillipie benecio del toro 
 get lucky hear scheme bigshot exec guy trophy wife going baby vitro fertilization 
 figure can kidnap surrogate mother played juliette lewis get nice ransom 
along way continually learn shady dealings exec wife hired goons bag man played james caan actor film looks like knows hes 
 exec kind money launderer obviously cant call authorities help 
 goons bag man kidnappers trail make different offers get mother back 
 execs son doctor also gets pulled fray wants make sure patient right 
meanwhile characters something hidden collective sleeves doublecrosses secret love affairs torrid pasts come surprise even though little relevance 
mcquarrie doesnt know meaning word simple 
 seems interested showing us clever making good movie 
everything complicated confusing much point surrealism 
nothing seems reality one movies get dropped right middle criminal world expected know industrys rules regulations 
every scene caans character exemplifies perfectly kidnappers already know even chat getting conversations business works hardly given clue theyre talking 
 characters probably supposed great criminal sketches theyre like ideas rippedoff sketches found david mamets trash 
 one really acts like real person story even removed reality 
 like dream without appeal 
take opening scene example phillipe del toro characters parking lot across street bar club counting money stuff 
 sit brandnew mercedes car alarm goes owner waiting line yells get away car dont move 
 guy loudmouth pottymouth girlfriend people cross street gang 
youd think phillipe del toro going pull guns scare away dont instead phillipe throws one punch two get beat mob 
theres lot things didnt understand scene first owner mercedes isnt yuppie old rich snob hes like hippie straight s 
secondly two main characters seem believe can actually take mob unarmed 
lastly serves purpose long run later film two packing artillery small countrys army 
 suicidal wouldnt gone kidnapping job first place get guns never explained either 
theres lot pick apart film exercise futility 
 comes nothing seems great movie pretty much story 
absolutely none characters likable believable 
 coated thin layer black comedy good chuckle film definitely flatout black comedy use seems like desperate attempt kill screen time 
 film see whether like can least understand appeal someone want make someone want see 
 cant say either way gun little going cant imagine anyone intelligently defending
