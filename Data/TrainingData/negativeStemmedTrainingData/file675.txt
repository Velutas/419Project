steve martin one funniest men alive 
 can take true statement disappointment film will equal mine 
martin can hilarious creating best laughoutloud experiences ever taken place movie theaters 
 wont find 
 old television series based moments humor wit 
bilko name isnt accident head army motor pool group passion schemes 
every episode involves sergeant men one another hairbrained plan get rich quick outwitting officers base 
 mchales navy s granddaddy 
thats idea behind movie difference farfetched usually goofy television series funny 
 one laugh film 
 remake retains goofiness entertainment 
everything just clean 
 obviously made hollywood back lot looks every bit like 
 looks brand new even old beatup stuff 
martin remarkably small bigger life role 
 original phil silvers played huckster heart gold touch sleaziness 
martins bilko pale imitation 
 semibright spot phil hartman bilkos archenemy 
 saying much considering martins lackluster character hartman leaves dust
