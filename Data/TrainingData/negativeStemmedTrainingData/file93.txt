 director nightmare christmas said previews im guessing said get people go see movie obviously hasnt worked since million dollar movie yet break million 
 however since monkey bone bad movie together technically wellmade 
 tragic waste talent incredible visual effects 
stu miley genius behind new phenomena monkey bone crude comic strip everyone wants merchandise go great links get well including dollars let fart powder 
 stu girlfriend julie bridget fonda freak car accident youll see stu goes coma coma stu travels im guessing dark town characters dreams come life 
people stuck town nightmares roaming around 
 stu spots monkey bone really cant stand tries keep control 
making new friend kitty rose mcgowan learns gets exit pass death can go back live life 
 monkey bone stu steal pass monkey bone becomes trader takes goes stus body

 considerably noticeable gaping plot holes lack character development 
 instance really dont get know stu julie even care 
kitty played well rose mcgowan ha story behind given chance know 
 cast decent however brendan fraser seems enjoying role stu miley becomes awfully annoying monkey bone takes body 
bridget fonda dreary seems bring film screeching halt performance bad seems miscast 
dave foley isnt given enough well will graces megan mullally can funny 
 standout performance voice nick turturro monkey bone funny entertaining really keeps film total bust 
 special effects monkey bone might really bring curious viewers special effects highly effective nice look eyes 
 believable unbelievable 
monkey bone seems like stuart little really dont realize animated 
 occasion sneaks 
 direction henry selick good times doesnt know kind film wants make ending climax falls cliff 
 bad really monkey bone real good movie heavily done hack job lack character development just sinks end credits role 
 curious however might worth rental avoid one
