 isnt much good movie 
 much can say acting directing writing make consider seeing movie 
 ill get one good comment way least joel schuemacher batman robin didnt direct titled technicolor city 
 fact nothing colorful movie dark depressingly gloomy right bitter end 
 plot tendency interesting passes laughing ridiculous things thrown fascinating movie 
 plot impossible explain due senseless gets will just touch bare minimum 
john murdoch rufus sewell awakes bathtub cheap hotel find forgotten everything 
john must find strangers k 
mind erasing aliens find use evil conspiracy 
 film interesting points raised human individuality existence inherently evil people 
 points however completely erased mind watch actors stumble dreadful script 
 mentioned earlier nothing atmosphere right film 
 acting bland since virtually character development one seems care 
 special effects low budget even hilariously fake sign true bmovie 
 direction poor little continuity expect movie switching realities constantly 
lastly script weak concept reality doesnt deserve word science sciencefiction 
 havent got point across ill say plainly bad movie 
lets hope next movie alex wish tim burton proyas least tolerable
