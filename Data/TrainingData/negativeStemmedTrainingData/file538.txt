fantastically hyped godzila finally lumbers onto big screen 
 film opens footage nuclear testing french polynesian islands attack boat beast finally join dr nick tatopoulos broderick looking years old research chernobyl 
 shady u s government guys appear ask come island massive footprints looks like giant lizard 
 whats beast heading new york 
gulp 
although godzilla non stop roller coaster ride points something curiously uninvolving unexciting movie 
 main faults lie acting writing common problems summer blockbuster movies 
broderick pretty useless hero humour tough guy image 
 emmerichs previous summer flick independence day wisecracks action jeff goldblum will smith neither 
also maria pitillo brodericks former girlfriend just useless chronic disability acting 
shes incapable showing emotion speaks every line way basically shes total crap 
 french actor jean reno save day indeed turning campy performance french secret agent 
shame little screen time overlong film 
hank azaria also turns crazy cameraman named animal adds little life picture 
also making appearance harry shearer probably best know voices simpsons slimy news reporter 
o k acting par never movies 
 script 
well thats par either 
emmerich screenwriting pal dean devlin seem caught destruction new york city forgot write script 
 dialogue banal broderick looks lot fish utters thats lot fish character development non existent reno plays typical frenchman croissant 
broderick forever remains geeky scientist 
also film seriously lacking sense humour 
 jokes uttered pathetic theres hilarious running gag siskel ebert 
 mayor mayor ebert assistant called gene 
ha ha ha ha 
 plot dire end just rips jurassic park lots baby godzillas e 
velicorapters running around new york 
right script acting suck 
 special effects 
thankfully theyre quite good 
godzilla impressive piece cgi although dont see much movie dark 
 destruction new york pretty well done aswell 
 although impressive cant save godzilla hugely disappointing boring movie 
 movie goes far long aswell cant seem decide ending 
 course ending leaves possibility sequel 
lets just hope one never arrives
