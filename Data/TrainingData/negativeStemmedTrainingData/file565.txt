 giant begins monologue thats funny distinctive princess bride medieval fairytaleinthe s feel 
 pleasantly surprised sharp comedy funny scenes occurring movie set romania talent agent sammy billy crystal visiting client monastery sammy ends mysteriously saved accidentally plunges car stream 
 sammy meets max giant mysterious savior played gheorghe muresan magic air albeit bit goofy loved every minute 
 film course plays size difference two times almost swear must special effects 
 particularly enjoyed shot sammy dangling legs maxsized chair two face enormous table eat oversized bowls spoons 
 also liked jere burns tvs something right performance director film romania 
 point primary flaw film gheorghe muresan incredibly hard understand particularly fastpaced first scene 
 unfortunate script required speak quickly right gate understand film continued became accustomed speech 
however time muresan becomes coherent characters head new york film takes dive 
 high board 
suddenly expected believe sammy dowhateverittakes slime ball 
 point pursuing interests sure didnt come desperate jerk 
 first scenes never lighthearted magical 
 now new york introduced neglected wife son character desperate enough involve max disturbing giant vs midgets wrestling match found quite unpleasant jarring within framework film 
indeed many scenes stuck film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces 
 includes scenes featuring steven seagal sammy gets max role big hollywood movie filming las vegas 
 enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun scenes appeared exist solely participation rather film demanded 
 audience required take huge leap believe max win role based quotations shakespeare 
 point found thinking supposed believe someone cast guy film 
 realized watching 
 final third film undergoes another transformation time unbridled sentimentality 
note major plot points revealed final paragraph 
max went america sammy promised reunited childhood love lillianna hasnt seen since normalsized kid 
 refusal see max unbeknownst leads us awkward ends justify means scene sammys wife serena played nicely kathleen quinlan poses lillianna 
 found scene offensive 
 rely deception induce warm fuzzy feelings audience reduced max someone pity coddle thought quite undeserved 
 think max handled truth gratuitous illness 
late film learn max fact giants heart condition shortens lives considerably 
 enlightening revelation film seemingly presents justify sammys transformation caring sensitive guy hey great dad husband 
 giant suffers poorly constructed story line undeveloped characters whose actions determined plot points rather internal persuasions 
 stronger story room character growth might possible focus maxs struggle accepted cast movies instead sammys struggles get money become better person 
 scenario maxs illness integral part film story motivator 
sentiment emotion followed naturally 
instead apparently supposed like sammy end allowed focus max 
crystal muresan give adequate times enjoyable performances end giant left feeling like id fed gruel giant spoon
