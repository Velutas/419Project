 tarzan lost city one anemic movies come quite 
 poorly written badly acted generally incompetent cinematic areas thoroughly uninspired insipid 
unfortunately bad way great colossal misfires like heavens gate ishtar bad 
instead literally drips screen like movie nobody wanted associated begs question made first place 
 good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced needless drek like make way big screen 
 course tarzan one filmed characters motion picture history appeared forty films ranged good s greystoke legend tarzan lord apes really bad s tarzan ape man bo derek 
 films just cheapie bmovies made thirties forties starring exolympic athletes lot cutsie chimps 
therefore another tarzan movie made one might assume something new offer different angle original storyline anything set apart others 
 greystoke added neverbeforeseen level realism pulpy tale even tarzan ape man least misguided audacity sexualize story vehicle bo dereks bare breasts 
 tarzan lost city hand absolutely nothing offer bunch recycled storylines bad dialogue 
 script bayard johnson j anderson black formulaic generic come 
comic books better plots 
 movie bad fact retains ridiculous tarzan call tirelessly mocked last summers comedy george jungle 
didnt producers think leave back old weissmuller pictures belongs 
 story starts legend tarzan already firmly established quick opening narration tells tarzan casper van dien found jungle raised apes return england assumes greystoke heritage 
 movie starts civilized english gentleman without english accent marry jane jane march less week 
however wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting fabled lost city opar one africas last great secrets witch doctor ancient african tribe summons tarzan back jungle 
 first jane refuses go pouting will interfere wedding tarzan leaves changes mind tracks therefore assuring lots lame smooch scenes apeman 
 film gets going sluggish way delves series jungle adventures tarzan jane natives attempt thwart ravens crew discovering city 
 socalled adventures cheesy predictable unexciting pace tension action speak 
 sequences stolen innumerable recent adventure movies ranging raiders lost ark goonies 
 movie running short action includes greenpeacefriendly scenes tarzan freeing caged animals releasing baby elephant trap throwing ivory tusks river 
 movie also lacking even remote hint reality 
 instance tarzan raised jungle bit cobra doesnt even attempt suck venom like semiexperienced weekend backpacker 
instead ties tourniquet around arm stumbles jungle plan survival 
 course one cant help notice fundamentally misleading title 
 ruin ending anything lost city 
 however lost pyramid suppose resourcestrapped fx department come special effects worthy madefortv movie 
 also brings question treasure hunters slog numerous underground caverns get lost pyramid sitting right middle open field 
strictly speaking tarzan lost city isnt even bad enough camp quality although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close 
 movie proves starship troopers hinted act sure looks wellgroomed even deepest heart african jungle 
van dien much much prettyboy effective tarzan hes calvin klein model loin cloth 
 also wondered makeup department thinking outfitted awful circa steve perry haircut 
waddington makes decent villain although hes like charmless version belloq raiders lost ark jane exmodel jane march little smile look pretty next tarzan 
 fire gun evil treasure hunters time two whenever snake comes picture reduced hysterical mess 
however amidst complaining one piece good news 
 tarzan lost city lacking ideas new old unable fill even hour half celluloid 
 can say much least decency short
