suicide pointless everyone know 
 whats movie like 
 guessed 
pointless 
 virgin suicides focuses lives five lisbon sisters perspective teenage boys fascinated 
 youngest lisbon sister commits suicide sets motion series events will change lives many people forever 
thats press materials film probably say 
now heres say virgin suicides huge waste time 
boring arty pretentious junk entertaining 
well committing suicide 
 movie lost early immediately following scene younger daughter jumps death bedroom window 
 girls father james woods holds lifeless body arms horrified family looks 
 scene ends lawn sprinklers come 
 joke 
 supposed amusing way 
 movie failed draw back 
performances saving grace virgin suicides 
woods plays character actually interest came onscreen performance kirsten dunst next youngest daughter lux worth mentioning well 
dunst potential big star chooses projects well 
 film awful manages come away virtually unscathed 
 also cameos film frustrate audience leave wanting 
 result seem rather pointless although theres brief role given michael pare eddie cruisers turns best role since 
well since eddie cruisers 
perhaps virgin suicides worked story told point view people little access main characters 
 never get significant insight girls might feeling theyre feeling 
 really know mrs lisbon kathleen turner strict keeps short leash 
 mother doesnt 
 certainly reason commit suicide 
 godfather part iii sofia coppola proved business front camera 
 virgin suicides proves business behind either 
 family connections doesnt entitle allowed make movies 
 attention film directors 
stop letting daughters pout way industry 
just share dna doesnt mean share talent
