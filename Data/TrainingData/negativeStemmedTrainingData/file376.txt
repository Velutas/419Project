 think films dismal failure due american filmmakers getting hold brilliant british comedy americanizing 
youd wrong since full blame can placed folks wrote created series rowan atkinson robin driscoll richard curtis 
 ever happen meet chaps favor 
grab hair yell really loudly ear thinking 
 ever heard phrase aint broke dont fix 
 walk away 
 film concerns mr bean atkinson visit america escorting painting whistlers mother american buyer played burt reynolds type bit part success boogie nights hopefully away 
now mr bean sent trip makes sense cant even describe film explains 
 point mr bean comes america causes wacky trouble 
problems problems problems begin 
first score music tv show completely replaced score either times one note away score beetlejuice one note away score rob roy 
 song choices totally uninspired 
 good vibrations 
 love l 
wow dont put thought guys 
also bean makes way much noise film 
 character doesnt speak much series really heard laughter audience maybe occasional murmur mr bean 
 episode like chaplin silent movie 
 film bean constantly moaning grunting whining etc annoying just plain wrong character 
 main problem though just funny 
 episode series dozens really great laughs crammed less minutes 
multiply running time three however laughs steadily decrease 
 even gaul repeat jokes series 
sad creatively lazy 
 series mr bean ran episodes 
 earth atkinson gang decide time completely rework everything 
 halfhour episodes certainly hadnt exhausted possible situations 
 can say positively film point almost appropriate ages wasnt couple scenes appears though mr bean sex things 
 even isnt positive statement 
please guys go back england go back television youll make laugh
