okay bear yall cause first get chest 
 hell damn crab 
whew okay 
cause clip shown beginning get nerves towards end cute crab maybe 
even know need footage 
 wasnt thing getting nerves 
 cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack pretty young faces sarah michelle gellar amanda sean patrick flannery tom might held appeal oh say first minutes movie 
 first movie moves along quick interesting pace 
 speedily established something magical happen amanda encounters totally random fairy godfather type person street whose aforementioned crab follows everywhere just doesnt die 
 ridiculous concept yes point im willing accept im willing accept amandas life changed powers received 
later movie cant seem decide whether powers come fairy godfather amanda falling tom 
 clips crab annoying werent just repetitive place unnecessary 
 plot stumbles along uneven speed sometimes dwelling long particular development amanda suddenly becoming great chef falling love tom etc sometimes moving quickly good 
 places plot just doesnt make sense sometimes way contrived crab bit example sometimes corny peaches emitting dry ice 
cant beat 
 plot seemed fragmented unconnected 
 romantic funny places 
 okay magic powers come crab 
 fairy godfather 
 can float now 
 sudden instead just making dry ice come peaches can put emotions food 
tom sudden just accepts amandas witchcraft end 
 people really dine restaurant resembles life death tupacs video 
 hell damn crab 
 unfortunate liked basic premise movie became fantastical tiresome 
 film seemed skirt around serious theme least theme towards end resolved show us long flashback clips minutes people crying tables 
 humor good places nolan gets funniest bits including incomprehensible totally random thing dolls 
gellar flannery qualified actors gellar particular charm much prefer playing saucy buffy even annette upcoming cruel intentions sorry excuse character 
 almost funny sometimes see two trying hard make dialogue sound better trying make relationship seem plausible 
 supporting character nolan highlight though reminded bit kevin youve got mail see footnotes 
 always typical chick flick romantic comedy theres seemingly endless romantic soundtrack background cued right places 
 sort got nerves 
 simply irresistible hard understand light funny places generally disappointing cant draw line romance protracted sap humor tired slapstick 
 refrain making pun 
 
 
 
 simply irresistible easy resist 
 first viewing 
 anyone else think tad bit similar youve got mail shop around corner 
business rivals fall love 
female counterparts business danger shut 
female mother like figure guiding 
 annoying hysterical exgirlfriends 
 really like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe
