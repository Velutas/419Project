 cometdisaster flick disaster alright 
directed tony scott top gun tells story asteroid size texas caught collision course earth 
 thought dinky little comet deep impact trouble 
jeez 
 great opening american spaceship plus city new york completely destroyed comet shower nasa detects said asteroid go frenzy 
 hire worlds best oil driller bruce willis send crew space fix globel problem 
thats like sending mouse cat carrier isnt 
 action armageddon top nonstop ludicrous words sigh hit head notebook couple times 
 alone 
plus see wonderful actor like billy bob thornton film like armageddon waste actors talents 
 film just reel show bunch snazzy fx shots 
 real reason making film somehow outperform deep impact 
producer jerry bruckheimer fails armageddon
