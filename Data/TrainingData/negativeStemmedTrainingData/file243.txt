 spice world just one long promotional film british girl band spice girls 
sure theres hint humor every 
actually theres couple pretty good jabs spice girls 
 overall cares 
 
 dont know now spice girls sing songs love friendship responsibility girl power yet dress like streetwalkers lower middle class neighborhood 
 spice world ride around big tour bus whining photo shoots give interviews 
amazingly talk keeping commitments upholding responsibilities really applies fun things things want things required keep earning money 
 keep babbling girl power really talking cleavage power 
 mean takes girl power one thread away bursting skimpy outfits 
 film pg really minor dialogue changes scene extentions youd one raunchy adult film 
 way theres something opening credits says based idea spice girls 
wow got idea credit 
 certainly wish new trend hollywood 
giving credit simply thought say girls lets make movie 
 supporting cast fares well 
roger moore real james bond mockingly plays clichespewing chief spice girls darn hes fun watch 
mark mckenney also good screenwriter trying pitch film ideas bands manager richard e grant 
one question though george wendt 
youd think spice world envoke one two reactions people 
 like spice girls youll like even afterwards 
 cant stand like spice world will really make sick 
oddly audience saw film roughly twelve yearold girls sat silence entire film 
well two sat directly behind 
 kept muttering stupid 
maybe hope humanity
