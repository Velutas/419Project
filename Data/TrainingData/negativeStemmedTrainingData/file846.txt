 contrast 
 space two days saw shakespeare love hurlyburly 
im sure get two different movies 
 former top telegraphing everything shoving philosophy life throats hurlyburly complete opposite wound tight much buried script one spend weeks thinking 
 one interesting movie 
 much similar vein one favourite movies company men although quite nasty 
theres lots talking scary insights world men 
hurlyburly doenst contain much plot just follow eddie sean penn around tries make sense life people around 
 big question pertain 
 supposed feel 
 means everything television friends events happen 
 guess summed crudely whats 
 movie answers 
donna anna paquin gives theyre really satisfying just lead questions 
thats makes movie stay mind 
 sorts questions occupy time 
even push background however resolve questions influences everything 
 performances superb hurlyburly 
 havent seen sean penn much fact cant remember seeing anything brilliant 
eddie isnt likeable character sean penn makes understandable 
 dont want friend id like help 
chazz palminteri also great phil making awful person 
id never want know phil still understand eddie wants friend 
everyone film nails performances making world real 
 nasty world sexist world 
unlike shakespeare love unfailingly politically correct hurlyburly mans world seen unapologetically eyes men 
 find fascinating two counts depressing 
first depressing world exists 
 large part hurlyburlys success convinces people real sort environment exists every day hollywood large number men believe women completely peripheral world toys playthings 
sure everyone background everyone else world women long way background 
second movies made stories mens world 
 stories womens world 
 soap operas chick flicks meant satisfy women real stories touch essence life like hurlyburly men 
hurlyburly based stage play evident moment film starts 
 talkative intelligent static 
 can make film drag bit people sometimes sound like theyre quoting textbooks mostly good thing 
 films filled special effects sweeping panoramas 
 films underestimate intelligence audience 
 means hurlyburly probably just effective video large screen 
 also means pay attention
