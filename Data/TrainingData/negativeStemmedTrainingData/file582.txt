 upon time jeanclaude van damme decent action hero 
 muscles brussels bursted hollywood market mindless adventure films boasting spectacular martialarts ability 
 excursions fun 
 now seems like watching van damme movie become painful chore rewards virtually guaranteed helping mindnumbing action 
 action goes sour left enjoy 
ill explain 
knock pair counterfeit jeans salesmen working office hong kong 
marcus ray van damme babemagnet stylish dresser heads company annoying weasel partner rob schneider 
 become part plot involving microbombs implanted counterfeit jeans seemingly mole business 
im going reveal everything next paragraph want review devoid spoilers skip onto next one 
im quite sure gives crap ill issue warning anyhow 
tommy really working cia 
 boss hammy flat paul sorvino mole wants cause carnage tiny immensely powerful super weapons 
 even stoops low put childrens toys 
 thought plot outline sounded intriguing probably will enjoy knock 
 think ridiculous setup couldnt even fill five minutes screen time without causing roll laughing might cup tea 
knock sucks 
 stoops ridiculous levels individuals conjure horrific nightmares 
 amazes far producers will go sell something simply van damme star 
 plot pathetic garbage strung together inane action sequences will baffle mind performances wooden use row canoe action absolute catastrophe 
director tsui hark teamed van damme superior still lamebrained double team helm rather attempt dazzle us fantastic camera angles engage us plot 
 suppose enjoyed camera work incessant desperation made rather nauseous 
 picture freezes middle action sequence speeds altered consistently camera tricks mostly apply traveling gun barrels weapons fired 
 sounds cool 
trust isnt 
 much scars say har har van damme terrible 
sure lots fancy kickboxing moves dodges giant crates greatest ease 
 looks like hes bad impersonation jackie chan performance stiff tired 
 hate say perhaps time mr van damme give day job 
 really test endurance watching knock 
 suppose theres enjoyment derived schneiders character extremely annoying provides films better moments 
 beautiful lela rochon movie 
hopefully grabbed paycheck fled premises like olympic sprinter 
knock doesnt even stand strong mindless entertaining action film like handful van dammes others 
 movie embarrassment entire action genre modern filmmaking 
 considering low hollywood stooped late department certainly saying much 
note self avoid universal soldier return upon release august
