 army comedy genre never turned truly good movie dont count neil simons biloxi blues 
year year predictably cliched military movies come recently sgt 
bilko none ever manage anything rehash last 
 thought stripes different 
 ivan reitman director bill murray star harold ramis costar coscreenwriter seemed like ghostbusters army 
instead bunch unfunny crap army 
murray funny sophisticated meatballs plays loser cab driver sees army chance success convinces friend ramis enlist 
 get obligatory drill sergeant hell headshaving marchingsinging sequences mindnumbingly stale ever 
 characters even less original ranging underachieving slob john candy incompetent captain john larroquette 
 big name stars stripes even larroquette fall victim lame rehashed material never really likeable murray particular 
 gets decent lines although barelyfunny one liners pale comparison hilarious peter venkman character played three years later ghostbusters 
 even better caddyshack crying loud 
 lot late s early s comedies stripes completely juvenile movie child like sex obsessed child able watch 
im sure seems funny paper candy pay mud wrestle five beautiful women watching coming mouth admonition dear god 
every seconds 
stripes isnt playful kind sex comedy either 
 time seems downright misogynistic larroquette uses telescope peer womens showers murray lifts female m p 
onto stove iknowwhatyoulike look face says hes going give aunt jemima treatment means shoving spatula butt repeatedly 
 dont want stick around scene progresses uses ice cream scoop genital region 
 im enjoying woman protests 
 sentiments exactly
