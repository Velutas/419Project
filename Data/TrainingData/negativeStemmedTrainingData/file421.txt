plot something bunch kids going haunted house playing parodies horror nonhorror movies 
oh yeah theres also something ghost possessing mansion shit trust wont care much plot film 
critique parody movies either work dont one just doesnt work 
 laughs arent pronounced time around energy level gags characters just seem going motions 
 like hurry finish film something wink wink 
 scariest part 
check number screenwriters took pen puppy seven 
 say took seven people write minutes worth fart jokes halfassed stunts spoofs films horror 
now im exactly sure writers wrote parts separately just tossed funny sketch ideas smoking chronic end result film basically plays like extended skit saturday night live 
 couple funny oneliners mostly just rehashed onejoke scenes lot dead silence lame gags 
add unoriginal title movie poster gotta start asking anybody even trying films website isnt even yet 
 f 
 however give james woods man opens movie funniest parody exorcist takeoff miss youve missed reason see flick 
 especially liked oneliner walked see possessed womans head turning 
 funny 
unfortunately film plummets straight dumb parodies many teen flicks nothing horror save last dance dude wheres car action movies like charlies angels mission impossible now help figure one will 
isnt supposed parody film horror movies 
 maybe thats just title film fing head 
well im sorry say horror film lameass script 
 wayans brothers known better look towards weinstein brothers money instead zucker brothers comedy sequel 
unfortunately us left skeleton film mightve funny worked times tightened injected solid laughs 
 things stand now doubt mind obvious greed capitalize success last years film led everyone path screw trying hard critically speaking course 
 ashamed putting enough real effort chopjob providing fans ultimate talents
