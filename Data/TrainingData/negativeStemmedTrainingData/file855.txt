 hollywood run interesting characters plotdriven suspense thrillers must spend two hours watching will smith gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue run around dodging fireballs 
 enemy state exactly right 
 parts net parts conspiracy theory enemy exciting watching smith talk cgi aliens s lame brained men black 
will guy ever get real role 
 bruce willis syndrome 
 plot bascially smith playing lawyer getting hot water high government murderers assassinated powerful political figure earlier movie tape killing gets hands 
 inlists help old conspirator hackman end er 
know 
enemy one worst films last year 
 sloppy telling story getting facts straight acting mediocre energy driven didnt like smith always magically outsmarted badies extra characters seeming intelligent smith somehow got run truck 
enemy came around time superior star trek insurrection 
 know two films different well everything fact enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels 
somehow quality cant overshadow quantity
