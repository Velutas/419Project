 shame execution concept falls short premise 
 movie lacking unsatisfying 
osmosis jones crude gross disgusting directed farrelly brothers twisted siblings behind theres something mary irene couple movies humor mostly targeted belt 
 theres anything wrong scatology 
 bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor 
 merely osmosis jones farrellys humor juvenile predictable 
 can almost foresee puns just viewing part inner anatomy sequence drawn 
osmosis jones looks like one old health class movies gone psycho 
 trouble animation may please young jokes may heads teenage audience may find tame tastes 
adults well lets just say will find unappetizing 
osmosis jones plays like minute infomercial eat healthy foods lobby 
 live action sequences revolve around frank bill murray seems grungiest human universe 
 continually looks needs shave shower 
frank much consternation daughter fastfood addict eating anything everything can kill 
 works zoo animals look cleaner presumably smell better 
franks body invaded thrax lethal virus frank eats hardboiled egg fallen ground 
 gross enough frank picks egg dirt plops mouth 
nope farrellys pile first frank wrestle chimp egg wresting primates mouth 
like said gross meter tips scales one 
 ingesting egg movie begins animated sequences 
 osmosis jones voiced chris rock renegade white blood cell teamed drix voiced frasiers david hyde pierce hour painkiller cold capsule battle thrax smoothly voiced laurence fishburne 
basically cliched copbuddy movie rife clich s genre 
 osmosis jones doesnt click 
 merely falls back tired familiar conventions instead creating new exciting situations 
 jokes puns lame osmosis searches snitch former flu virus 
 pumping information drix tells osmosis funny doesnt look fluish 
 jokes dont rise level 
 live action scenes better 
frank slob unappealing difficult fathom ever married even sired child 
hes almost bigger cartoon animated characters 
osmosis jones movie may violent young children thrax burns dissolves blood cells right left 
 animation rather twodimensional flat 
 lacks scope depth 
 unappealing movie will leave scratching head maybe leaning toward shower walk theater
