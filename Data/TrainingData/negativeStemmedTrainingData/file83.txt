edward burns tackles third picture looking back like previous two workingclass relationship picture 
however unlike previous work film dwells personal story female protagonist 
 looking back stumbles making slow boring film without spark enlivened previous work 
claudia lauren holly small town waitress feeling stifled life 
shes turning point life feels shes going nowhere 
 boyfriend michael jon bon jovi broke dead end job 
 marry shed never get chance escape town 
enter charlie edward burns claudias old flame 
 skipped town several years without explanations even 
 claudia 
 come back town see suddenly torn 
 stay stable michael never escape hometown 
 ignore instincts fall charlie 
part answer lies character mother blythe danner fell wrong man spent life pining claudias father return 
now seems claudia make mistakes 
 little past ninety minutes looking back rather short genre 
unfortunately seems much much longer 
 storyline simple uninspired theres lack energy whole proceedings makes entire drama rather tedious 
edward burns makes misstep casting crucial role egomaniacal old flame 
theres one restrain ego reigns unchecked 
 walks room lauren holly swoons yeah 
right 
lauren holly can central character 
 never understand character makes pathetically bad decisions 
 never really care 
bon jovi sympathetic character whole movie 
 acting talents much greater might seem given mostly bland ineffective role work 
theres much recommend looking back 
 film bad 
simply boring 
theres zest aspect film reason spend ninety minutes watching
