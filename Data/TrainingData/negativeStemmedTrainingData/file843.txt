according publicity material movie directors hope restore good oldfashioned bowling rightful place mainstream american consciousness 
hmm 
 never know just might something 
 rise geek chic lounge music seventies fashion evercontrary kids nineties might just latch bowling another terminally unhip bastion tackyana claim 
 doubt kingpin will anything 
 cheesy right connoisseurs bad taste will find film exudes bland smell stale jokes rather invigorating stink true kitsch 
thats shame first ten minutes film promises lot 
woody harrelson plays hotshot bowler rise roy munson 
 movie opens fifties roys dad dishing readers digestgumpian wisdom scoopfuls shifting s hilarious spoof saturday night fever 
 sardonic tone proceedings much enhanced presence bill murray delectably slimy big ern mcracken 
 thanks murray first quarter kingpin seems good gives wry derisive edge otherwise rather unfocused comedy 
mccracken dupes munson hustling job abandons angry mob mangle roys hand 
 fast forward years later munson fat balding loser prosthetic rubber hand 
hes hopeless meets ishmael randy quaid amish amateur bowler munson takes protege 
 together set million dollar bowling tournament reno picking pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel way 
 exit bill murray filmmakers seem one direction go thats 
dumb dumber 
yes indeed kingpin brought modern proponents laxative humour peter bobby farrelly directors aforementioned jim carrey vehicle 
 prepare much slaparound comedy flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair bull semen 
get set stock fishoutofwater situations cityboy roy puts beard tries blend amish community suaku straitlaced ishmael takes smoking striptease unchristian neighboursocking 
now dont get wrong theres nothing wrong cheap humour fair share lavatorial laughs woody randy 
 trouble jokes arent bold funny enough drive movie bumbles along without much sense direction 
 lurches sports movie amishmocking roadtrip sentimental melodrama pausing broadside spoof indecent proposal many shameless plugs accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting together 
 gags fall flat lack buildup bits pieces movie simply dont anything 
 long unfunny fight car park 
 two 
 guy wear mascara guy glass bowling ball rose 
 film full halfthoughtthrough ideas give impression old gaffer grip makeup artist throwing random stuff saying wouldnt funny 
well actually 
 actors dont movie much favours either 
woody harrelson comes okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical innocent implausible script calls randy quaid ceaseless ham vanessa angel talent like schwarzenegger seems convincing playing computercreation human take tv series weird science please 
 
even murray hams reappears movies climax 
 fairly useless attempt comedy certified nohoper kickstarting bowling renaissance 
well look reinspired john waters perhaps somebody strictly bowling anyone definitive bowling comedy 
 flying inkpots rating system wait video 
 little creaky still better staying home gotcha 
 pretty good bring friend 
 amazing potent stuff 
 perfection 
see twice
