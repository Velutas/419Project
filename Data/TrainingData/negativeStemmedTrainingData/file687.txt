look new version psycho came world didnt end 
 guess gus van sant really isnt bringer apocalypse 
unfortunately though psycho didnt end world know best thing can said 
van sants controversial retelling alfred hitchcocks classic film polarized filmgoers everywhere even premiered 
without benefit actual viewing many said film will best suck 
 almost good critic waited actually saw decide film best sucked concludes use word suck hopefully thoughts braindead orangutan 
director gus van sant took original hitchcock film refilmed shotforshot using exact script minor alterations 
 inherent challenge making film suspenseful scary even though large group audience will know exactly will happen exact time 
suspense probably attained actors able create something new different original 
sadly occur 
 hard overshadowed vera miles john gavin original psycho exactly happened julianne moore viggo mortensen 
 moores case film helped x files gillian anderson cast instead especially since moore goes entire film scully impression 
 cold demeanor expressions rigid way forming sentence moore scully 
mortensen liked g 
jane opts play sam loomis cowboyhick nice gone past starting point 
sam twang cowboy hat thats 
mortensen turns one uptight performance recent memory 
anne heche janet leigh role good things brief time screen 
 least marion crane little life cant said rest cast 
 best work though comes vince vaughn demented mamas boy norman bates 
hes going make anyone forget anthony perkins effective naughty nice 
 best part film dinner scene heche vaughn simply talk 
 solid acting something carried rest film 
van sant made boring film 
 camera tricks hitchcock eloquently used arent eyecatching now 
 passed brilliance copied many times many directors dont impress excite 
van sant assume grasp originality decided put streamofconsciousness images famous scenes lamb middle road 
 images included questionable editing choices took away scenes caused first bewilderment later laughter 
definitely hitchcocks intention 
 least danny elfman good sense mess bernard herrmanns original famous terrific score 
 film like psycho frighten whats point 
aside norman characters thinly drawn people leave connection audience 
 things van sant company done least make recreation interesting 
 end however new psycho noble attempt alas dismal failure
