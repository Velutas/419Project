starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff right first problem fair game casting supermodel cindy crawford lead role 
 cindy bad just anyone watches film knows moment one little bit casting done cindys extraordinary acting skills extraordinary ability look drop dead gorgeous situation 
 fair game situations tend find cindy either soaking wet hot sweaty im sure just coincidence doubt situations essential plot fact cindy looks great wet well thats just happy coincidence 
sure 
william baldwin isnt bad actor 
unfortunately just doesnt demonstrate movie 
im sure thats lines just hokey trying make cindys acting look good 
 latter worked 
cindy surprisingly good job first movie 
 say doesnt room improvement 
although fair cindy lines kinda cheesy places 
 right now doubt asking sort movie cindy crawford arguably beautiful woman planet chose foray world cinema 
well im glad asked question 
cindy plays lawyer convoluted plot twists becomes target former elite kgb agents 
 woud target someone likable cindy ask 
 end movie wont care 
 story contrived isnt funny 
anyway cindy gets blown window house without getting much scratch might add placed protective police custody watchful eve william baldwin 
whos character max kilpatric police detective seems possess skills sort fighting machine guess writers seen way many steven seagals early films 
 point idea crawford baldwins characters run killer russians isnt bad idea just everything around basic idea kinda stinks loud 
 supporting cast members nothing acted stereotypes 
 baldwin id hope film disappears 
 crawford may indeed acting ability 
unfortunately obscured writing goes beyond bad 
 movie obviously written cindy mind since writers spend time finding ways capitalize looks 
 bad hadnt spent time half decent plot since ms crawford capable looking just fine thank much 
unless huge fan either baldwin crawford movie will disappoint
