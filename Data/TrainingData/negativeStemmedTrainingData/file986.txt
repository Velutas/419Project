boy great movie 
keanu reeves morgan freeman acting together director fugitive andrew davis back give us another thriller beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown boot 
 blockbuster 
 diehard keanu reeves fans read 
ol much ado nothing plays eddie kasalivich machinist studying university chicago 
 help pay rent takes job making machinery hydrogen project conducted university 
 happy coincidence also happens stumble solution final problem thus one knows key performing feat miracle physics 
 project holds great promise taking hydrogen water giving energy put 
 potential solution earths energy problems without pollution cost 
surely nobody problems 
morgan freeman paul shannon projects sponsor 
 works powerful organization disagrees paternal project leader quickly technology released public 
 figures world will disintegrate anarchy results project released quickly 
 murders project leader blows project great short scene sort like mini id citydevastation thing tries simulate experiment hitech hushhush location 
unfortunately intrepid machinist english physicist weisz manage get away now follows fugitivelike chase using dissimilar rehash movie script 
 movie just dying comparison fugitive 
 movies use chicago main city since place doesnt change much guess cant really blame setting paucity atmosphere 
 trouble fugitive harrison ford tommy lee jones chain reaction keanu reeves fred ward 
credit arent really given much chance empathise characters 
 ford able work within confines movie evoke sympathy eddie kasalivich just doesnt seem believeable reeves character never given time develop 
 might better investment film give characters depth spend less time chase sequences frankly get quite boring 
harrison ford man world 
 alone world didnt know trust came across real well 
 chain reaction keanu reeves isnt alone 
now fine fleeing couple chemistry really portray paranoia vulnerability confusion 
 dont get 
 get thinking hes still speed now sandra bullock english accent probably doesnt drive bus hardly contributes anything movie 
 producers probably thought hey keanu rachel dont hit well 
lets rope morgan help us 
well keanu rachel didnt hit well screen unfortunately morgan freeman doesnt help much either 
 thing come really know paul shannon always full load cigars cigar holder 
 really fault 
 andrew davis just doesnt take time build characters 
someone must convinced time round cinema dollars best earned making movie run like headless chicken 
 flying inkpot rating system wait tv broadcast 
 little creaky still better staying home gotcha 
 pretty good bring friend 
 amazing potent stuff 
 perfection 
see twice
