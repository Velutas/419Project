vikings v bears 
 isnt lineup monday night football 
rather two opposing forces will battle death th warrior film dramatically flat gratuitously gory 
based michael crichtons book eaters dead viking saga tries evoke mysticism fabled norsemen glorious battles fought 
 strength honor eventually etch place history among greatest warriors ever picked sword 
luckily vikings however warring abilities clumsy film 
antonio bandaras ahmed travelling ambassador 
accompanied friend omar shariff cameo eventually come across small viking village 
 see vikings extremely proud group whose greatest strength fortitude 
 laugh heartily revel arrogance sing songs battles won 
 festivities halted messenger boy arrives tell village leader great evil threatening land 
help needed quickly 
 elderly fortunetelling witch arrives 
 brief incantation proclaims warriors one norse blood needed ensure victory 
personally always wonder people believe oracles look haggardly brink insanity 
nonetheless men eagerly accept place ahmed becomes pivotal th 
 group sets greatest battle lives 
 course ride ahmed becomes target fun burly viking warriors 
 ably shows size dog fight rather size fight dog 
 able overcome proud arrogance vikings will skills group enough defeat whatever evil menacing countryside 
 look promising 
 creatures resembling bears strong high morale 
 fearless display desire decapitating heads enemies 
 attack hundreds next strike will come soon 
 warriors prepare defenses pray gods 
 ready sacrifice lives 
 good way die says one fallen warriors 
despite largerthanlife battle sequences unmoved entire experience 
 many points even confused 
 example somewhere middle film subplot creeps involving prince threatened land 
 seems agenda elevate greater power crisis 
however subplot never fully materializes left scratching heads purpose inclusion 
 questions real problem story little offered characters love hate 
 leader viking warriors charisma 
however banderass role completely underwritten unclear th warrior makes special 
 entire rewrite ahmed character order 
also much action takes place torrential downpours night made battles difficult follow 
 preferred time looking viking culture beliefs shaped decision battle enemy 
 stands film manages confusion intensity 
 make thor cry
