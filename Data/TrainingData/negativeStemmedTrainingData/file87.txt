lucas wise start star wars trilogy episode episode boring empty spectacle features nice special effects 
 familiar long time ago 
opening film starts opening yellow crawl features every star wars movie computer game 
 plot trade confederation blocking supplies peaceful planet naboo ruled queen amidala portman jedi knights quigon neeson obi wan mcgregor sent negotiate deal confederation stop blockade 
however simple blockade seems jedi knights soon deal many dangers including facing evil darth maul ray park 
 also meet future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd 
star wars largely failure major areas filmmaking script direction characters 
 script desperately tries make thin boring story two hour epic 
 trade confederation plot just exciting death star film goes drama becomes nonexistent 
theres underlying tension urgent need see outcome 
 film also takes leisurely pace telling boring story doesnt help 
theres snap make film work moves plod 
 script boring characters speak morals especially anakins mother 
theres group spirit evident characters can speak profound statements bark orders evident much going happen 
 two leads hideously boring static characters given little much time 
quigon obiwan hold presence film give little audience root 
 audience will probably warm bad guy darth maul given screen time 
maul one underused bad guys film history even provide straight plot line film plots film concluded throughout trilogy 
anakin annoying unlikeable 
instead cute huggable lucas doubt intended 
 probably surprising hateful little boy unfortunately blessed ani everyone knows joins dark side kills everyone quickly possible 
 comedy relief supposedly provided gangly jar jar brinks although end none provided film 
although floppy features will doubt great stuffed toys lines actions given painfully unfunny 
 good laugh tongue burned pod racer knew wouldnt able talk 
queen amidala nothing film serves real purpose apart fact must serve people go googoo anakin 
 role will become important later episodes given little 
 actors dont help movie much either 
liam neeson seems bored embarrassed seems desperate leave movie quickly possible 
mcgregor comes across posh mothers boy little charm 
 casting director must chose hes scottish like alec guinness theres little explanation 
natalie portman plagued hideous costumes poor script delivers spunky performance 
 jake lloyd looks everyone hateful eyes delivers lines bored voice 
theres little talent evident hard see lucas chose better child actors 
hes even cute 
 main claim film special effects okay 
theres nothing impressive yet complement story well 
 cgi takes away much human element however 
 battle droids example replacement stormtroopers characterless little computer graphics lacking humour humanness came stormtroopers 
episode just disappointing 
 got high production values little else 
 music meandering except near end 
 plot gives us noone root even care 
 effects nice dull 
 plot goes half hour longer 
theres air manufacturing among whole sorry affair many clich s catered throughout film 
apart remotely exciting pod race sequence episode dry affair serves little purpose except make money get us watch episode see happens many unfinished plot lines film 
disappointing barely word 
rating
