heres something chew whats favorite food big cheesylooking special effects monsters like one lurking bowels luxury liner deep rising 
 obvious answer question cardboard thats depth fully developed character painfully generic creature feature 
deep rising demonstrates originality vitality something scripted computer 
 fact considering rigid adherence expected formulas perhaps 
 astonishing thing deep rising exceptionally high level gore 
 since starship troopers many chunks flesh human nonhuman scattered directions 
 learn bloody trivia well sea monster spraypaints red drinks human spits liquefied remains halfdigested leftovers 
 suppose deep risings gallery grotesque images represents fun stuff love macabre doesnt much 
 surface thats level film can analyzed deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic everyone else citing equally valid alienstitanic connection since james cameron directed 
 going big disaster angle titanic tongueincheek mayhem tremors deep rising somehow misses marks wide margin 
 film humorous tense exciting 
 fact downright boring despite half length camerons current boxoffice champ deep rising feels like longer movie 
 really necessary say anything plot 
probably since easy guess ill go ahead oblige anyone wants synopsis 
 film opens introducing us gang bad guys board mercenary ship 
 addition usual cast psychopaths lunatics theres finnegan treat williams boats pilot whos supposed indiana jones knockoff joey kevin j oconnor inept sidekick whos supposed lovable funny really just irritating hanover wes studi mastermind use term lightly operation 
 goal attack cruise ship clean safe sink using illegallyacquired torpedoes 
 problem time reach argonautica titaniclike luxury liner turned marie celeste 
aside beautiful jewel thief famke janssen couple crew members theres one board 
 reason soon becomes obvious ship taken bad special effect supposed resemble octopus teeth eight tentacles 
 cast led treat williams primarily comprised hasbeens probablyneverwillbes two exceptions wes studi best known villain last mohicans djimon hounsou amistads cinque 
williams cant miss prospect hollywood fallen far favor best can days lead role film like deep rising inability create charismatic interesting figure may sink whatever left sputtering career 
famke janssen will forever known xenia onatopp goldeneye perfect bland match williams 
given limited acting abilities likely chosen part primarily basis physical attributes 
unfortunately bra defeats purpose wet teeshirt half picture 
meanwhile kevin j oconnor entirely much screen time exhibits appeal fingernails scratching blackboard 
 days audiences becoming difficult impress computergenerated special effects 
 lesson writerdirector stephen sommers previously helmed liveaction jungle book needs learn 
 days jurassic park viewers astounded mere spectacle seeing something big imposing screen past 
now moviegoers looking sophistication titanic visuals wellincorporated impossible tell end reality begins 
 deep rising monster like everything artificial unconvincing 
unfortunately fundamental problem audiences faced isnt much idiotic monotony individual picture poor quality entire bankrupt genre although fair deep rising particularly bad entry 
even film sunk sight knowledgeable viewer knows wont last kind 
like slimy slithering things inhabit air vents pipes movies waiting just around corner ambush 
 consideration unlike anything screen truly horrifying
