first impressions critically closetoawful film moneywise will continue great 
 sometimesfunny film sags lags oftentimes gets boring 
 orginal plot grows old real fast 
one minute films ive gotten bored 
men black defied odds 
 first saw flick minutes long thought maybe poor attempt independence day type film just ran gas 
however now realize men black run gas film minutes manages show original idea summer audiences embraced becomes old minutes movie 
tommy lee jones will smith play two government agents responsible keeping order alien society 
 ridiculous plot begins alien bug played weirdly vincent donofrio great full metal jacket lands earth retrieve galaxy thats somewhere orions belt 
anyway basic plot revolves around jones smith stop bug getting galaxy higher power will blow earth 
 premise ridulous didnt like film 
 love original plots 
 one original one 
 director barry sonnenfeld something film ruined plot made film drag also put unncessary elements found romance films 
whenever saw donofrios bug stomp eat people film got terribly boring 
 smiths wisecracks fill gaps wasnt enough 
 also believe screenwriters elected subplot tommy lee jones missed former lover alien agent cant contact humans really 
 see jones satellite computer watching lover plant garden 
 sentimental moment alien movie 
nice try dont think 
 doesnt work 
 just makes movie even ridiculous even boring dont aliens worry now joness conscience 
 came movie wanting see joness conscience wanting see real action movie lots aliens 
maybe unfair partly judged movie expectations 
nevertheless even though parts indeed funny plot movie grew old boring quick
