 first big event movie turns anything 
gary sinise stars astronaut removed mars mission astronaut wife maggie kim delaney becomes ill passes away 
don cheadle given mission along russian couple young hotshot 
 strange whirlwind shot top mars mountain range attacks crew mission sinise robbins convince superior let neilsen oconnell perform rescue mission whatever crew might remaining 
 discover surface planet will dramatically change lives forever although one watching film will come away profoundly affected 
 ever saw film aware promotional campaign dr pepper 
every time see bottle soft drink mission mars logo emblazoned upon 
little know plot taking back seat product placement drink several products 
dr pepper saves day one point dream sequenceflashback features jerry oconnell shoving mms face 
 couple ridiculous examples product placement scattered throughout film 
clich s also order day mission mars 
dialogue character motivations lifted directly countless science fiction films done better style even independence day lifted premises scifi films better film dont like independence day 
films like space odyssey abyss close encounters third kind blatantly stolen poorly 
 even sequence rover traveling canyon couldnt help whisper utinni wait jawa quickly hide rocks rover get glimpse 
 film also features one alltime least favorite movie clich s wanted moment one character gives another trinket yet another character established constantly usually made fun character ends getting sappy later 
scenes like always bother come nowhere regular films film clich ridden particularly irritating 
ennio morricones music usually considered best stuff projects works dreadfully overbearing 
 music sounds like came straight vincent price movie certain scenes 
 times music unbearably overdramatic 
one sequence involving daring spacewalk rescue given particularly cheesy sting discovered grappling hook device used rescue wont reach intended target 
mission mars push button filmmaking greatest extreme 
events set motion obvious anyone ever seen movie seem like just evoke emotional response audience 
 apparently supposed upset tim robbins character removes helmet deep space kills save wife felt extreme boredom coupled twinge disinterest 
 makes worse fact real reason robbins character needs turn popsicle except invoke emotional response think least one way save nasa clowns film supposed smarter 
 finale finally introduced translucent conehead kittyfaced aliens ostensibly sprung presented ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put film just slightly worse plane crash end air force one hell scenes spawn 
 brief history lesson came proffered sinise whisked away rest people late wife proclaims video watches early chance step foot one else 
 press ive seeing film receive apparent mission mars will dying quick death theater 
im sure first weekend two will huge word gets people will stop going 
lets just hope upcoming red planet better isnt hurt negativity film generating 
id venture say wont worse waste time 
pg
