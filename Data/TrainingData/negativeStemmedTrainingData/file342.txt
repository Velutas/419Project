 know movie issues everyone audience comes laughing 
 comedy 
 strange career path director chuck russell 
 starts career decent take nightmare elm street series debut director installment number three 
 follows blob next year waits another six years next piece little film called mask starring jim carrey one star vehicle eraser two years 
 thought let wait another five years get weak script jammed cliches hope jimmy smits kim basinger pull ashes 
strange dude one crappy flick 
plot sixyear old girl believed kind mysterious prophet sent god 
 satanic cult wants girl switch side girls aunt wants well 
save damn devil worshippers 
enter one occult expert agent plenty bobo cops lots nuns praying youve just got gist things 
critique plot holes size ass movie barely squeezes sense clich ridden plot wasted talent cheezy effects bad dialogue unintentional laughs boot 
whats good movie 
well rufus sewell pretty fun watch head creepy runaway childrens sheltersatanist supreme seriously wicked eyes just enough ham performance go cheese lying around 
 little girl also pretty good unfortunately character doesnt really much 
 believe actually enjoying films first half hour starts promise bonehead moves bonehead moves protagonist basinger just drown films entire basis believability 
 reason takes time anyone figure niece gifted even longer figure every move makes 
 dumb one 
add entire police force incompetents save jimmy smits whose talent agent advised playing exact cop character nypd blue good career move 
 least change clothes jimmy zero scares zero thrills even less actual drama youve got pretty bad movie 
 respected actors like christina ricci ian holm take bit parts movie 
 owe director favor something 
together barely five minutes screen time suppose riccis hospital room scene might worth look horndogs 
 worst part movie hilariously unbelievable ending features police officers coming brilliant idea sneaking mans house know guilty crime 
uuuhmm hows 
 knocking door arresting sorry ass officers 
anyway dont usually inscribe spoilers reviews stupidity characters just difficult describe without validating solid idiotic proof plenty go around 
 basinger lose acting talent hiatus profession oscar win 
difficult say lines really bad just delivered poorly 
either way little originality obvious computer effects little thrills little drama little entertainment value certainly bestow honor one worst movies summer upon film 
 really dont mind rehashed gobbledygook various satanic kid based thrillers enjoy watching films dont bring anything new table well 
drink beers smoke beans rent video may just one funnier thrillers year
