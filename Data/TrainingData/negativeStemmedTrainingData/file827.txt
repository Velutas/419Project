ive always preferred mushrooms blotter acid 
dropping acid like riding roller coaster blindfolded idea peaks valleys idea next terrifying decent will send stomach throat idea long ride will last 
 theres hard knot gut clenched teeth come ingesting strychninelaced dose 
mushrooms hand offer psychedelic equivalent leisurely ride ferris wheel steady reassuring assent short period thrilling motion color smooth landing 
acid daredevils mushrooms refined seekers joy 
 point fear loathing las vegas director terry gilliam made acid movie wish made mushroom movie 
full shocking sight gags aggressive images grotesque comic performances film certainly offers something fans hunter s thompsons book want experience twisted pharmacological worldview inside 
 us just want enjoy wellmade film gilliam produced mixed bag 
fear loathing tells ostensibly true story selfprofessed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came las vegas cover motorcycle race found trapped middle district attorneys convention ingesting every conceivable drug available man means 
operating pseudonyms raoul duke dr 
gonzo two men careen vegas acid mescaline bender hole hotel suite binge amyl nitrite cocaine tequila rainbow multicolored uppers downers 
 terrorize every one meet mostly every one meet terrifies 
duke hallucinates giant bats way town attacked horrifying lizards casino lounge 
dr gonzo becomes enamored thickbladed hunting knife begs duke throw tape player bathtub just jefferson airplanes white rabbit reaches climax 
 guys dont just trash hotel rooms rape humiliate leave dead 
 neither ends dead jail testament blind luck providence depending point view 
thompsons book besides hilarious read stood test time important historical document 
 simultaneously exposed s drug culture sham exposed las vegas place american dream came die 
pontificate want film illustrates thompsons message truth stripped bare essentials gilliam wrought drug comedy 
 cheech chong movie 
youre watch depp del toro ingest lot chemicals laugh results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall 
theres nothing wrong concept gilliam tries hard 
 frantic movie sweaty closeups wideangle lenses dutch tilts otherworldly lighting schemes 
 times gilliam really put convincing representation acid trip screen 
 end 
much dialogue comes verbatim thompsons book priceless comic observations 
 youre hard pressed hear digest amidst jumbled camera work 
 brings us performances strike wrong 
depp plays thompson groucho marks filtered george c scott patton gimmicky performance works biting satire thompsons dialogue 
 several puking scenes del toro fares better dr gonzo also mumbles sputters many lines weight lost 
watching two made wish movie made twenty years ago dan akroyd john belushi leads now something see 
 interesting note alex cox credited cowriter screenplay originally slated direct gilliam took 
 much fan gilliams work cox better choice 
sid nancy coxs best work covered essentially subject matter cox able pull back allow characters sid vicious nancy spungen carry film 
gilliam commits compound sin overdirecting film uncertain purpose 
 kind movie trying make anyway 
 doesnt try cautionary tale doesnt work broad comedy 
 considered carefully purpose result much interesting film 
 dont want hard 
 truly funny moments youre good enough mood might get kick 
 however recommend watching fear loathing las vegas influence favorite controlled substance guarantee will enhance effect
