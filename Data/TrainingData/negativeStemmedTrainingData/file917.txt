ah going along well 
 shes dubious distinction worst movie ive seen far year 
 quite frankly doubt ill see anything equally bad 
 least hope dont see anything equally bad 
 shes tells story popular guy school played freddie prinze jr accepts bet transform geekiest girl school rachel leigh cook popular 
 right problem 
 many times seen storyline 
 cook comments near end film kind like pretty woman except without prostitution 
 course filmmakers attempted try something new material wellworn storyline device propell movie forward 
 though shes relies completely lame overused formula push ahead 
theres one original interesting character film either wasnt bad enough theres one good performance featured 
 star movie rachel leigh cook simply horrible 
 usually dont like get personal case think needs said 
cook wears expression throughout flick looks miserable time 
 never convinced nerd transformation unconvincing unnecessary 
 movie seems saying better popular 
 freddie prinze jr actor ordinarily enjoy quite bad 
 coasts film socalled charm never establishes real character 
kieren culkin brother cook 
 indiscernable reason hes got hearing aids 
 explanation given theyre never brought 
 supposed feel sorry just wore hearing aids 
 dont think 
 single element film one offensive things ive seen movie long time 
 shes sucks 
thats boils 
 entertaining even good time passer 
 hour half running time goes slower minute hairremoval system informercial 
 whats worse sends bad message teens 
 appears telling hey doesnt matter youre happy way 
thats unimportant 
 want truly happy dress latest fashions act like bubbleheaded moron 
ugh
