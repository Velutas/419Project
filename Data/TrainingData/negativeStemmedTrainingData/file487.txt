okay starship troopers one worst movies hit theaters long time 
 fact might even worst major release film come years 
 even decade 
 bad beyond belief 
 suggest paying money see 
theres good chance youll regret 
 see free still want walk 
go right ahead 
 movie starts cheesy scenes set future world buenos aires 
 meet group horrendously bad actors actresses playing obnoxious easyto despise withapassion characters love triangles love rectangles love hexagons screwing life 
 long go join military primarily interest sex youngsters joined 
 train 
 strut around nude reason whatsoever 
 hour making audience scream agony start fighting bugs 
 big bugs look nice even though design okay 
unfortunately fights boring since want characters dead anyway 
cue agony 
 characters sex

 cares 
cue agony 
 movie ends audience runs cars vomits pavement attempts drive home 
unfortunately torture cant think straight dont pay attention road many ugly car wrecks

well batman robin kicked movies sorry butt people 
starship troopers succeed action movie 
 succeed drama 
 succeed war movie 
 succeed comedy 
 succeed satire 
 succeed parody 
 succeeds horrible 
terrible 
gutwrenchingly bad 
 wanted run away movie every minute 
 paid money owed others see movie got better 
 stayed 
 never got better 
frequently impossible got worse 
 movie written acted directed basically just feels whole like mental maturity level free willy whole thing feels like movie threeyearolds enjoy 
except ridiculously gratuitous blood gore pointless nudity 
 written little children children definitely go anywhere near 
 course recommend everyone 
dont go anywhere near 
verhoevens got streak going now 
 last movie showgirls 
 seems trying see bad movies can get people finally stop coming 
showgirls failure appears though itll lucky make near budget movie will still okay grosswise 
 really bad 
well 
troopers four five lines dialougeshort humorous scenes actually funny mostly want know 
commercials pop throughout story promoting joys joining troopers 
 adds seconds entertainment still one hour minutes seconds miserable torture 
im totally confused way people really enjoying movie 
 admit 
 youre willing possibly put torture go ahead see decide love hate 
 dont know anyone thing love movie hey 
feel free give shot 
 course interest saving souls dont recommend 
 guess 
alien resurrection comes november th already seen read script assure will blow pretty much everyone away 
though opinion starship troopers reasonably split itll difficult find someone wont like alien resurrection theyve seen 
 possibly years best intense action film least one best 
 really want see alien warfare thats played intelligently seriously see alien resurrection 
please avoid
