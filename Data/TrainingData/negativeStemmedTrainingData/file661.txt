 get annoyed seeing people talk cellulars public places shouting loud giving ratts ass anyone around basically just wallowing selfimportance 
well will likely agree rating film since basically features trio annoying ladies bickering away phone hour half make hug end 
aaaaaaaahhhh 
plot three grownup sisters living separate lives begin reestablish communication lines dear old dad falls ill 
critique good movie wasnt fact got little say features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations chockfull bad acting moments provides less emotional satisfaction thirdrate afterschool special 
 im nice 
 junk like gets made beyond happy ephron sisters will finally dealt professional blow considering regurgitation level material just reached limit 
 true emotional moment demonstrated meg ryans character dad film hugs swings around christmas tree lot 
wow 
deep 
 course christmas tune thats played every ephron flick chimes background characters continue build bonds among one another making reference old quaint movies movie stars 
stop im 
gonna cry 
 film mess 
 characters boring irritating watch plot something three selfish sisters talking phone whole lot kind liking father really finally realizing error ways sharing emotional moment movie stars s 
admittedly expecting much film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds big dog rolling eyes even surprised level ineptitude came acting efforts put forth film 
meg fine sister cries lot looking adorable ever someone please put lisa kudrow inside permanent home limited range cause woman basically character plays every single movietv show shes 
enough already 
 diane keaton mustve spent time thinking role behind camera one cause acting amateurish best 
neither one convinced emotional scenes 
granted gave walter matthau best lines film thats probably rating three points comes 
 movie funny unless youre one chuckle train wrecks provides zero drama unless consider loud phone conversations moving generates absolutely emotion although tear meg hugged coffee machine ends perfectly pretentious note oh please dont get flour donna karan dress
