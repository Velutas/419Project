critique pretty bad movie 
lets see start 
okay first story just plain boring 
 original entirely predictable lacks energy 
okay whats next 
acting say 
hmmmm well main actor justin chambers basically uncharismatic version chris odonnell less range think mena suvari just plain 
 bad thora birch dungeons dragons entirely miscast bad deliveries awful sequences pisspoor accent comes goes 
now im sure ms suvaris fault directors ive definitely seen much higher level film 
 semisaving grace actorwise tim roth irrepressible bad guy something havent seen 
thousand times guy

alright else bad film

yikes hows taking notches fellas 
 thing blares ear whenever feels need accentuate certain scene actually little annoy 
 think important man behind music recognize film isnt real epic stretch imagination 
 fluffy rehashed cakewalk created shrewd studio heads decided take advantage whole kungfu phenomenon films test old classic 
dudes 
failed around 
 keep reading 
 editing also pretty shoddy movie dialogue banal stilted plot problems plentiful 
 guy top horse carriage just stand opponent takes forever scampering way back top 
 dont just cut mouseketeers rope top tower instead jumping chords fighting hanging 
 doesnt anybody look day older sequence says years later 
 least change 
 shirt man 
keep mind never strayed away championing certain movies created simply sake fun time flick just didnt cut 
 boring stretches acting atrocious times romantic scene suvari chambers next lake reminded plays high school made cringe little reason care anyone since musketeers fat 
 will give movie much main reason raisondetre french say fight sequences come despite lack numbers film 
 hoping movie packed cool stuntwork promoted trailer see essentially snippets two major cool swashbuckling sequences film 
 first comes right beginning movie essentially finishes film hanging tower juggling ladders 
 ladder sequence definite keeper unfortunately rest movie just regurgitated crap
