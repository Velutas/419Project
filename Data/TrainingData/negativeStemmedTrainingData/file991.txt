man one wierd movie 
similar conspiracy theory couldnt decide genre 
 first hour standard stock aliens clone nicely created eerie atmosphere ship 
 last half hour 
 makers blew script airlock just decided screw lets just kill everybody 
 forget scifi 
movie becomes horror 
 really dissappointed movie tried scare entirely wrong way 
instead using clever tricks trying build scare movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts short quick bursts gore yawn everyones 
seen knows expect 
 one thing done well lead finding happened previous crew 
 skeletons lying around mangled mashed 
 finally painfully restored new crew views video 
 acting isnt bad considering actors work anyway complex interesting dialogue speak 
 nice camerawork certain sequences though like hull near bridge event horizon breached camera pans back follow specific objects bounce across deck sucked space 
 movie much better 
 good experienced cast deserved work 
 just nothing new us havent seen aliens hellraiser
