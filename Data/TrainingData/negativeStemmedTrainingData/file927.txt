 fellow critic stated belief reviewer speak review 
ive attempted obey rule recent months impossible case 
 fact nearly every person goes see phantom menace brings baggage 
 original star wars trilogy means much many people 
 calibrated creativity child masterful original works art mix moving stories astonishing special effects time still hold pretty darn well 
 young seen star wars theater original release doesnt make less dedicated 
 contrary star wars trilogy empire strikes back particular three items short list love movies 
 heard george lucas making first trilogy ninefilm series got exited 
 first saw screenshots film well year ago embarked yearlong drool anticipation 
 first previews released last thanksgiving ready see film 
 hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilms secretive snobbery picture 
 last weeks picture opened multitudes fans waited outside theaters stood boiling sun days advance just first ones theater tired hearing 
 tired seeing cardboard cutouts characters whenever went kfc taco bell 
 just wanted see movie 
reader misunderstand 
 antihype reaction 
 hype unavoidable 
 understand accept hype just happens prequel widely beloved films time get released 
five minutes phantom menace knew problem 
 jedi knights 
 asked 
 churning stale dialogue machinegun rapidity 
 arent characters developed adventures 
 special effects shot nearly every frame entire film 
 just questions early 
later asked wheres magic first three films 
 looking watch every fifteen minutes 
 end film tired maddened depressed 
george lucas funneled wonderful movies pointless mindless summer blockbuster 
 phantom menace star wars film 
take away title jedi talk force youre left easily one vacuous special effects movies time 
 embarrassment 
 looked desperately scene character explored new theme examined special effects shot isnt used 
 theyre token attempts 
 fact george lucas created simultaneously abysmally bad excuse movie pretty good showcase digital effects 
 wanted see 
 didnt want leave phantom menace headache bitter taste mouth 
 story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost confused apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor scarcely line film attempts liberate people planet naboo 
naboo victim bureaucratic war trade federation contact naboo queen amidala natalie portman teenage ruler truly cares people 
 picking jar jar binks completely cgi character voiced ahmed best head tatooine meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd mother pernilla august 
quigon knows force strong young anakin jedi knights take boy journeys 
 bad guys darth maul darth sidious neither enough lines register characters 
 isnt anything particularly wrong story looking synopsis form 
 way lucas handled however unsatisfactory 
first dont learn one single thing quigon jinn 
 one thing 
 life like film 
well imagine didnt one 
thats feels like plot device 
 probably explains neeson looks hopeless role hes recently retired film dont blame honestly 
obiwan character really looking forward learning even less interesting 
mcgregor just lines anyone hoping see engaging young actor great performance urged look elsewhere 
since two men focus phantom menace lucas served us big emotional void centerpiece movie 
things start pick characters reach tatooine young anakin perhaps truly fleshedout character film lloyd thoughtful job role 
 also hugely impressed sand speeder scene rarely action sequence fast exciting 
 anakin says goodbye mother found moving 
also fairly good portman manages give little depth character depth written 
jar jar binks one annoying characters ive ever endure hes interesting humans 
 soon relativelybrief segment tatooine back mindnumbing special effects depthless action scenes 
ive seen many movies qualify special effects extravaganzas phantom menace first one ive seen sick special effects fifteen minutes movie 
 reason obvious george lucas restraint 
 cant say didnt find effects original final battle darth maul obiwan quigon visually exceptional film 
 also found effects deadening tiresome 
 breaking point near end picture anakin getting questioned yoda jedi masters background see hundreds digital spaceships flying around digital sky wanted go away 
cant one stinking scene isnt bursting seems special effects shot 
 got sick looking cgi characters spaceships planets backgrounds really just wanted go outside look physical landscape hours 
 theres question magic 
 lost sixteen years phantom menace return jedi 
 feeling lucas focused movie looked forgot entirely way feel 
john williams familiar score help lucas direction 
 think comes right characters none 
 longed magnetic presence han luke leia got thing 
 ridiculous expectations 
mine werent high simply wanted film showed roots films grew loving story characters great special effects 
instead got two hours fifteen minutes lifeless imaginative computer graphics show 
 dont hate phantom menace much resent id like forget exists yet cant 
 stay 
 can hope episodes ii iii something substance dont lucas will pulled impossible task destroying indestructible series
