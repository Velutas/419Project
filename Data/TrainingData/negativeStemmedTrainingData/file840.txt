isnt ultimate sign movies cinematic ineptitude cant think much say sucks 
one first official year releases supernova movie 
 cant seem get past oneword adjectives one although boring stupid absurd doesnt amount much review 
 shame 
 able save chore desperately trying elaborate 
 cest la vie 
 goes nothing 
ill keep short 
 suppose first bad omen supernova came director walter hill hours removed name movie requesting replaced pseudonym thomas lee 
 films fate sealed many minds struggling studio mgm declined screen press event usually signifying studios lack confidence particular movie 
hills mgms actions prudent 
 captain medical space vessel nightingale dies tragic hyperjump accident reformed drug addict also first officer reason james spader forced take command 
 ship picks distress call nearby planet arrival picks one survivor apparent accident abandoned mining colony 
one crew members angela bassett knows passenger played peter facinelli bad feelings know means 
 intergalactic hitchhiker carrying mysterious cargo jellylike substance purpose unknown though seems bring form pleasure whoever touches 
another one crew members experiences first hand spending minutes partially inside glob goo impressive handstand pushups 
evidently touching enigmatic eggshaped thingie makes younger stronger 
 
 
 movie never bothers explain 
soon enough though spader bassett running around ship like mad chased allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli 
 honest dont even remember exactly 
 just remember didnt care 
supernovas plot suggested less interesting ideas ball goo intergalactic time bomb dropped chance develop anything truly intriguing 
 fact everything dropped just actors can fun running around looks like elaborate set 
well effects good though theres hardly studio movie bad special effects days im sure whether thats remarkable accomplishment 
 performances hardly worth talking 
im even sure can call whats performances though angela bassett sure good giving people finger 
james spader bad actor proves one blandest action stars ive seen mostly isnt given character personality 
 action scenes just bland since theyre pretty much just rehashes action elements werent particularly entertaining first time around 
 since action scenes everything movie pretty much dead water 
 life cant figure called supernova
