 following review contains spoilers 
 please someone stop joel schumacher vomits film canister tries pass movie 
 chuck dowling jacksonville film journal 
 wrote sentence review s batman robin 
apparently one heard words 
oh wish heard 
oh wish someone stopped 
 hes done 
 plot mm similar paul schrader film hardcore surprisingly decent engrossing tale 
 fact everything mm 
 opening minutes mm see private detective tom welles nicolas cage working case prestigious member u s government 
keep fact mind cage trusted important case solves 
 returns home wife new daughter even finds time rake yard keep mind important well 
hes hired rich elderly woman solve mystery 
 husbands death comes across film private safe 
 appears snuff film sort urban legend pornography industry someone actually brutally murdered camera 
 woman wants welles locate young girl film hopefully disprove fact snuff film 
 sets journey sordid underworld sleaze discover truth film 
 main problem mm whole film completely pointless 
welles actually selected case old womans lawyer anthony heald actor always plays type character bad guy 
 first see first instinct hes behind whole thing 
 choice casting film 
 welles begins investigation times will see shadowy figure following 
 person possibly lawyer someone sent lawyer one knows welles even investigating anything yet 
 first instinct now confirmed 
 fact revealed lawyer part whole thing tells welles chosen case young inexperienced one ridiculous since going kill anyway tell whole thing moments 
 earlier see welles hired case hes told hired comes highly recommended 
huh 
also lawyer reveals part whole thing main goal get film back 
 give first place 
 lawyer film whole time gave away private detective thinking just give case return film 
 totally absurd 
 screenwriter seven 
late film theres confrontation main characters struggle one characters guns ends underneath car 
cage handcuffed bed rapidly trying get gun table 
james gandolfinis character goes gun car supposed scene suspense 
 see gun just slightly reach side car hes trying reach instead going around car side can easily reach just keeps stretching 
go around side car 
 goes minutes 
 cage gets gun gandolfini decides best go around side car 
boy schumacher really really getting nerves 
 think final straw cage returns home devastated everything hes seen case longer able rake lawn 
 actually see shot pathetically poking leaves yard 
 things bugged mm one music can call 
whenever score starts sounds like techno music awful indian middle eastern type music will accompany 
awful decision joel 
another cages performance 
 point hes capable wide range performances either good bad 
 mm delivers wooden one shines hes interacting joaquin phoenix gives great performance porn shop clerk heart gold helps cage case 
youre capable much better mr cage 
now mr schumacher 
im starting doubt youre capable anything else besides urinating onto institution american cinema
