 twenty minutes mission impossible director john woo killer hard boiled face appears made exciting elegant charming spy thriller kind post millennium james bond adventure strapping american read unsophisticated hero willing drop kick villains fox 
sadly picture progresses final product begins bear closer resemblance souped twohour long episode magyuver 
 particularly good one 
 went wrong 
mi begins flashily enough initial flash leading us believe itll soon give way something plot gives way flash digresses presumably unintentional parody much slo mo posturing countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem deliberately leap way tom cruises firing gun just can die really cool 
early car chase soon lovers ethan hunt tom cruise nyah nordoffhall thandie newton woo works trademark magic 
 one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence director slows action languid semistall cruise stunning opponent stare one others eyes come hither sexuality just respective cars smash spin accordance coming ever close toppling neighboring cliff 
prior see famed trailer opener cruise climbing steep mountain sans scaffolding leaping one jagged rock formation another 
 
 havent foggiest 
 doubt even john woo provide logical reply 
 mi woo become slave summer movie machine one jettisons logic gravity defying effects story gravity defying effects 
 possible spies adrenaline junkies climbing mountains crashing means get though course never explored 
 scenes ive described really included titillate give insight character 
god forbid 
woo certainly knows make set piece energetic remain individual set pieces never connecting form anything splices beer commerciallike visuals 
still terms crackerjack eye candy opening much cherish 
cruise newton first meet vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices graceful slow mo artistry synchronized movement juxtaposed stage romance two attractive individuals discovering attractive 
 frantic dancing woo trains camera cruise newton make sensuous eye contact 
 scene little top bon jovi music video circa kind way yet style something soul woo casts bit spell us 
sure smoke mirrors can see happens talented maestro behind particular product 
thandie cruise later meet bathtub scene thats half playfully charming jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting sight 
 flirt exchange obvious double entendres 
newton bats eyes flirtatiously 
cruise grins little slyly 
 cruise character ethan hunt drastically altered since first film 
 cruise plays hip sexual dynamo square jawed robot impersonated part 
hes cool dashing precisely kind role want see cruise watching sleep walk eyes wide shut might just longest episode red show diaries ever committed film blustered way magnolia quite possibly overrated performance s 
sadly film progresses see less cruises initial im man 
charm slomo closeups preening mug 
mi falls apart nearly every level repetitious third act essentially one hour long action sequence just wont stop 
 whole thing commences utterly generic gun battle first gun fight film really unheard john woo film alas particular battle couldve staged anyone renny harlin joseph merhi course excepting symbolic pigeons seem find way every john woo picture 
weve seen guys slide across floor slo mo firing gun hand 
 isnt done differently 
 action pure hard target broken arrow theatrics nothing propel apparent need see tom cruise drop kick face less villains hair whips stylishly wind 
hes cool sure hes made empty movie 
 actor isnt used much boyish appeal chiseled looks smiles narcissistically camera literally moment gunfight one one 
 hes beaming away hes staring lens cold eyes trying look mad hell woos editing seriously undermines effort 
 fetishizes cruises angular face glee turns naked gun style spoof 
 half expected cruise peel facemask reveal hes really austin powers 
 classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past fiery doorway glaring baddies within frame like pinup boy angel death 
 gunfight turns daring escape turns reckless mission turns motorcycle attack bad guys seem angle directly cruise kill like kind mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps bike gun toting cruise basically inviting handsome hero shoot mid air 
 lead bad guy played appropriately british dougray scott cruise face mentally deficient game chicken motorcycles 
though instead jumping side last moment two grown men leap directly giving mid air bear hug fly hundred feet still bear hug position land beach begin manoemano fist fight ends bad guy pulling thought dead 
 worry cruise takes care problem without even breaking sweat 
 hero 
 may noticed opted describe iota mis plot 
 reasoning simple im sure good 
 film absolutely concern story hurtling forth next special effect 
 wasnt kidding told friend mine mi less plot average aerosmith video 
nobody will go plot theyll surely regret 
 summer movies evolve devolve character plot become increasingly whittled nearly nothing 
 mi plot seemed built around brian de palmas films director stylistic flourishes mi plot serves give us intermittent breather woos nonstop masturbatory pandemonium 
 irrelevant every sense character 
 ultimately matters pesky smoke mirrors
