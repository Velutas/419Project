 happy bastards quick movie review 
damn yk bug 
 got head start movie starring jamie lee curtis another baldwin brother william time story regarding crew tugboat comes across deserted russian tech ship strangeness kick power back 
little know power within 
going gore bringing action sequences virus still feels empty like movie going flash substance 
 dont know crew really middle nowhere dont know origin took ship just big pink flashy thing hit mir course dont know donald sutherland stumbling around drunkenly throughout 
 just hey lets chase people around robots 
 acting average even likes curtis 
youre likely get kick work halloween h 
sutherland wasted baldwin well hes acting like baldwin course 
 real star stan winstons robot design schnazzy cgi occasional good gore shot like picking someones brain 
 robots body parts really turn heres movie 
otherwise pretty much sunken ship movie
