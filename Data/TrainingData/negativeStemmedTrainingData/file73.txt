stubbornly crow city angels backtracks beginning previous film lees eric draven found drawn back grave charles bronson thugs tortured girlfriend death 
 remember first film primarily harrowing exercise brutality 
 flashback see excruciating crimes exacted eric lover watch realtime eric pays perpetrator back kind 
 loud repetitive true sadists delight also horrifying fascinating 
city angels gives us less skillfully 
theres audience guaranteed film like although bad reviews poor wordofmouth will likely ensure wont much success

 time ashe frenchaccented actor vincent perez retrieved watery death young son shackled together shot thrown pier crow serves link worlds living dead

 major stylistic failing cant seem direct action scene quick nonsensical cutting ensues reminiscent low budget kung fu movie 
 director must also shoulder blame little screenplay wasnt performers couldnt apparent lack ideas parts everyone involved 
 bought david s goyers anemic script anyway 
 producers crow either dim realize story doomed hollow rehash cynical figure audience know difference
