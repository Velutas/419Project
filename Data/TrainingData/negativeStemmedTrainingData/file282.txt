 great actor james woods said im paraphrasing sex isnt messy youre right 
 truly profound statement one made entire mad slasher genre just replace sex mad slasher film 
 uninformed souls mad slasher genre subgenre melding horror exploitation elements put service plot follows identical outline usually masked always crazed killer stalks kills attractive teens la halloween 
urban legend mad slasher flick one sanitary bloodless nudity free irony laden dialogue beautiful though overly talented cast closely resembles overlong wb television special 
 film makers gore one two weapons disposal stale frightfree horror movie stephen king said paraphrasing cant scare audience gross em cant make em laugh 
alas urban legend succeeds latter though intention 
 actually find fact film became minor success million domestic box office gross frightening anything 
 seems audiences tastes whittled degree movie even claiming scary given benefit doubt 
 promotion urban legend sure promised thrills can anyone three digit iq argue provides 
unfortunately kinds flicks will continue produced people longer expectations one idiotic superhyped blockbuster flick another desensitized audiences point films dont need anything promise good time without added pressure delivering 
 anyone disagrees love explain box office successes shit like batman robin wild wild west godzilla 
 forget goes without saying mad slasher films exploitation offshoot will made without ounce craft especially considering sheer volume produced 
allow present real fault mad slasher film lack enthusiastic exploitation 
 flicks arent harnessed lofty aspirations break free give audience bloody good time 
sadly literally hundreds made estimate maybe three worth 
 urban legend certainly included amongst three 
despite considerable production value absence boom mics slipping frame just awful budget entry slasher sweepstakes 
 far possibility good natured exploitation urban legends setting alone offers myriad promising possibilities takes place college campus always appropriate playground crazed killer 
 see campus community made almost entirely young people midst strange hormonal surges percolating beneath surface 
 young people growing together going kinds inexplicable emotional highs lows naturally weirdness expected 
 better elusive crazed killer 
coupled copious amounts scantily clad coeds running around introduction little exploitation proceedings relatively easy task 
 alas urban legend idiotic clich full way clean slasher flick whole family nudity little gore much stupidity 
 kind movie killer drags dead victims scene crime reason dunno exercise 
 kind movie villain calmly purses runninglikethewindprey yet still manages catch prey really awful editing techniques 
 kind movie characters run just loud clash reverberates soundtrack 
 really wish filmmakers just retire whole loudnoisejumpscare thing 
yes audience jumps momentarily frightened wouldnt anyone loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated quiet room 
 lost hope possibility genuine scares urban legend ten minutes caught glimpse killer 
apparently filmmakers running creative ways disguise mad slashers 
 scream ghost mask scary enough know last summer fisher mans rain slicker middle summer less urban legend disguise sinks level mel brooks parody villain wears oversized parka fury hood ooh scary intended conceal hisher identity 
 urban legend humbly suggest donald duck costume 
though must admit urban legend winning premise somewhat entertaining exploitation film 
 films killer slices dices comely college students tune famous urban legends know like babysitter gets threatening phone calls find theyre coming inside house 
 wont spoil surprise urban legends used film offer fine cable viewing happen intoxicated enough 
sad say doesnt include favorite urban legend fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere unhappy gerbil 
now scary 
 leave like bring attention third irritating thing film first lack craft second lack exploitation characters just annoying group people ive ever spent evening 
 jared leto looking like carbon copy rob lowe back day alicia witt resilient heroine avoid vexatiousness 
 annoying bunch tie noxima girl rebecca gayheart sitcom star michael rosenbaum supremely irritating lout irritating actually cheered painful death cruel person 
ironically aggravating sacks human waste provide entertainment film viewed vicarious fantasy urban legend can mildly entertaining 
 movie features kind faux hipsters cant stand getting slaughtered least better watching entire film people cant stand getting slaughtered
