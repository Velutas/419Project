 payback brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut coincidentally previously penned awardwinning screenplay s l confidential wildly uneven thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller takes one ideaa movie nonstop violence death villainsand runs say barely manages crawl away 
mel gibson yet another disappointing picture conspiracy theory lethal weapon anyone stars reprehensible villainhero porter man becomes determined get share stole robbery back partnerincrime gregg henry drugaddicted wife deborah kara unger doublecross shoot leave dead 
porter dead howevernot long shotas quickly rehabilitates along loyal prositute girlfriend rosie maria bello sets make everyone involved scam pay 
 tagline payback get ready root bad guy sure enough true pretty much every significant character appears crooked way 
 wouldnt problem offbeat detail painfully thin story interest wasnt therefore found especially laborious time investing wide array character absolutely redeeming qualities whatsoever 
 attempt made flesh roles threedimensional characters vacant signs anyone sort humanity 
just protagonist bad guy played mel gibson doesnt mean will root didnt 
quite contrary every person movie deserved die gory death although anyway just spice dull proceedings 
since none respectable actors payback actually human beings play one performance managed stand 
lucy alexis liu t v s ally mcbeal plays spicy sm dominatrix brightens every scene definite flair comedy something liked seen since humor fell resounding splat 
meanwhile gibson perfectly fine sleepwalks role least bit challenging 
unger made impression s game surprisingly wasted difficult see took part since disappears ten minutes two purproses get high heroin plays key part early flashback 
finally kris kristofferson appears throwaway role climax unnecessary plot development sticks like sore thumb tellingly didnt appear original cut film cast extensive reshoots took place months later 
like action movies star often takes licking keeps ticking 
 course minute running time payback porter shot three times back hit van beaten feet smashed sledgehammer 
 guess 
 survive whole ordeal happygolucky penultimate sequence can still walk 
even though looks like recently substituted punching bag 
 payback way entertaining film even though sure makers hoped graphic carnage goes take away violence basically left blank screen 
perhaps director helgeland smart consider least added worthwhile elements like fresh storyline characters even remotely stand around hours
