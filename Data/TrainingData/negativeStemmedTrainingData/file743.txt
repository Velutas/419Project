masters universe pinnacle action figures combined science fiction fantasy cool names like mekanek stinkor came little comic book read 
 course animated series produced filmation remains one wildly successful television products world history 
given tremendous success toys cartoon mention moderately successful spinoff shera princess power inevitable production company put two two together come result trillions make liveaction masters movie 
lets blunt masters universe bad movie 
 story painfully dull mindnumbingly cliched hands wouldnt guess heman skeletor take fight real world acted either incredibly untalented actors dolph lundgren heman one good actors james tolkan meg foster given awful characters dialogue cant help seem terrible 
 extremely clear someone making movie wanted good star wars 
 alien bounty hunters desert skif technology stormtrooper lookalikes musical score reminiscent john williams deja vu polite term use describing 
 blatant uninspired ripoff appear appropriate 
tv fans might want check courtney cox monica friends robert duncan mcneill lt paris star trek voyager early careers well either 
 face mindless submediocrity anything make masters universe worth watching 
yes 
one incredible good reason 
 name frank langella 
langella always one underrated actors hollywood appearing countless films years 
 plays skeletor villain piece 
dressed opulent black velvet robes bearing skull face one part darth vader one part emperor two parts grim reaper 
given character langella falls right style precision 
skeletor believable interesting manages tread fine line homage past startlingly original right 
masters universe 
 remember loving eleven 
 twenty one difficult see 
 said blessed superlative villain makes entire thing worth tedium remainder 
besides year marks films th anniversary 
watch friends good laugh celebrate
