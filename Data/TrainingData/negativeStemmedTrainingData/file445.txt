 makers spawn created something almost vacuous summers comic book adaptation batman robin 
 films make mistake adapting screen look graphic counterparts also monosyllabic dialogue emptyheaded character motivations 
 panelsized morsels implausible plots rambo esque dialogue often overshadowed artwork thirty foot silver screens much difficult dismiss shallowness behind pretty pictures 
spawn ostensibly assassin named simmons white framed corporate baddie played without irony sheen set fire left dead 
though movie skimps next plot points heres determine said assassin becomes leader satans army tutelage flatulating midget named clown leguizamo grating always 
 renamed reasons unbeknownst spawn granted really cool costume enables become something human chameleon 
 spawn spies birthday party child realizes cant evil superdemon hes expected sets avenging untimely death 
typical summer blockbusters spawn effectsladen ninety minute rock video 
 visions hell laughably crude think virtual reality sequences lawnmower man spawns prehensile outfit action sequences truly something behold 
 storytelling completely lacking emotion spawn longs wife dont single scene together simmons death conflict will triumph anybodys guess believability expected 
 many questions left unanswered im sure wont addressed inevitable sequel 
 last years crow city angels suffered similar problems narrative lazy somewhat incoherent atmosphere spare genuine moments hypnotic power 
spawn inyourface screaming banshee film guys know graft comic book onto celluloid havent faintest idea make movie
