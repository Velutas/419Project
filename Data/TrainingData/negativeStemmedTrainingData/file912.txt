well goes another one 
sadly like movies year wasnt good 
 one almost bad omega code quite 
 opening credits good feeling bad well guess right 
 bad excuses acting horrible screenplay straightout bad direction bachelor terribly unfunny movie doesnt work levels accept fact rene zellwegar give good performance 
 two cameos brooke shields mariah carey also good brooke best 
 movie troubled start chris odonnell hugely miscast gives one worst performances date 
 stupid plot chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton man just broken girlfriend meets anne rene zellwegar instantly hit together three years 
jimmie decides wants bring relationship little bit 
 really doesnt realize anne thinks wants marry wants never catch 
 proposes really bad way shoots mad 
 course tries apologize nothing seems help 
 grandfather dies learns left jimmie million dollars 
long marries next day pm 
now jimmie must find anne try marry get money loves get married someone else get money leading unfunny predictable ending leaves bad taste mouths 
ok maybe one dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy date real big laughs 
even supporting roles artie lange hal holbrook ed anser arent even good 
 plot good idea script written less five minutes five year old 
 choppy dialogue bad directing dont help things 
even though chris odonnell gave ok performance two batman movies give even remotely good funny performance wanted boo throw pop screen get rid 
rene zelweggar different story gave charming sweet likable performance usual really thing saved confused movie total huge washout 
 sister played marley shelton also good two good chemistry onscreen 
brooke shields showed funny little performance bigheaded mogul became routine old 
one really cant help think seen stuff 
 like original idea end everyone knows going happen due cliches typicalness 
 bachelor works good levels fact doesnt work 
ed anser hal holbrook wasted terrible roles mariah carey can act save soul film movie career dispite terrific music career 
chris odonnell bad actor casper van dien saying great deal 
 seems held back really doesnt get character much even first minutes gets annoying old 
artie lange just seems like trying another chris farley completely unfunny unnerving 
 filmmakers want waste cast bad movie bad acting dialogue question will know 
maybe thought become hit critical success sometimes dont agree critics movies even trailers film made look bad showed mildly funny parts 
 based silent film seven chances sure better mess 
even though may think good date movie see will want pull thier hair scream thier money back 
besides terrible movie bachelor well terrible movie 
 nothing worth recommending therefore really cant recommend movie 
 good time laughed three times 
 running time movie minutes wayyyy time needs shortened least thirty minutes 
parts seems go forever parts seem last enough time 
 one worst movies year can sure hope will make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies give filmmakers
