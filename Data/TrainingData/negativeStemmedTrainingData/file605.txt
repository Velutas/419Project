thats pretty much essence movie say becomes quite boring times slow 
 aside story well presented probably quite close representative source 
 acting particular found good character development also quite interesting alas story simply hold interest enough get movie 
 things story didnt sit well example original scam coverup heavily involved character played sharon stone yet end character played relatively small role seems utilized story along better 
 flip side character played catherine keener found interesting thought developed well helped story lot 
 characters aside movie interesting merits end lacked story pacing 
 far acting casting movie concerned say choices nick nolte jeff bridges great well catherine keener 
 people acted parts admirably part sharon stone played played well part utilized enough
