movies like six days seven nights make mad talented people like harrison ford anne heche ivan reitman put lot hard work script worth ten cents 
 script written michael browning decided instead thinking new ideas hed rehash lot cliches omit even slightest bit character development throw drugdealing pirates provide highlevel action sequences explosions 
 good scripts highprofile actors can make see truman show instance 
six days seven nights simply waste 
lets see 
 
 
 get harrison ford anne heche alone island 
 
well well make feisty magazine editor well make crusty old pilot 
 wait fianc e can david schwimmer 
 wait fianc e will harrison ford crash island alone 
 know 
theyll get vacation spot shell get called back 
yessssss 
 theyll crash island will funny five minutes 
shucks 
oh ive got 
well throw distracting subplot fianc e sex really attractive woman acts like bimbo can feel guilty 
 anne heche kisses harrison ford kiss otherwise nobody will want see movie will vindicated action fianc e will already cheated 
 obvious reason theyll accidentally run pirates try kill 
oh yes 
 feel good story 
instead using characterization propel events will completely random yet totally predictable 
imagine 
dont get wrong six days seven nights boring picture ford heche great job 
 sparks fly brownings inane dialogue drowned actors sheer force talent 
 almost every scene energy performers bring screen found laughing pretty hard 
schwimmer also funny manages milk scenes whatever can get 
 reitman made good films least tries make things exciting 
even though pirate subplot profoundly dumb prepared pleasantly sidetracked action sequences 
 just start think story contempt film surfaces 
 picture feels like hacked pieces wouldnt surprised five six inept subplots edited completely 
 ones bad come think let audible groan get first glimpse pirate ships id just like shake producers shoulders scream pick awful script 
 film outright stupid elements subtly horrifying 
 instance take subplot schwimmer character sex bimbo feels really guilty 
 serious problem real life six days seven nights reduces chance complexity weak plot device actions makes okay heche kiss ford 
 script lacks even glimpse intelligent subtlety find odd strangely insulting device ended story 
 summer movie season doesnt mean movies dumb 
 far one worst years recent memory summer blockbusters 
 line six days seven nights heard woman front ask two tickets new harrison ford movie 
 didnt know name film 
 suppose just didnt care 
 bothers even people make bigbudget pictures dont realize films becoming parodies 
good actors sign good scripts hollywood insists making flicks rake cash least assume wed like spend money story worth ten cents
