however still smokes lucky strikes detests forms authority kills whim 
beyond updated film retains little resemblance original pulpy pageturner spillane probably infamous often reviled mystery writers

 movie splits completely book dives convoluted improbable tale government conspiracy mind control tactics involving mafia cia one hammers vietnam vet buddies kinky sex clinic 
many characters book appear movie take slightly different roles

 jury one several cinematic renditions spillanes books including version made d film differs earlier versions one major way includes sex violence spillane wrote never given screen treatment due hollywoods production code 
although takes version jury closer core original subject matter aspect film received criticism took new license extremes many argued surpassed book 
rest assured movie includes great deal nudity thoroughly violent especially toward women 
 features one woman neck slashed set twins forced strip stabbed death psychotic sexual deviant programmed cia judson scott another woman shot pointblank belly hammer 
 one deny spillanes writing definite misogynistic nature movie seems take step giving glorious screen treatment constant equation sex violence much played intention erotic quite unsettling 
 surprise movie like book fades black dead woman floor 
 jury troubled production wellsupported studio made one explanation didnt well theaters many people forgotten ever made 
 script written larry cohen best known creatively cheesy nonetheless effective monster movies like alive two sequels q stuff 
cohen wrote script thinking going helm project well yanked directors chair weeks worth shooting already budget 
 quickly replaced richard t heffron worked last three decades handful undistinguished movies dozens television projects 
heffron obviously brought talent make movie rapidly efficiently 
 shows final product 
cohen personal interest updated version hammer heffron none 
 shot movie quickly clumsily although scenes ring true flat trite invariably dull 
 movie features numerous car chases shootouts stunts heffrons background television dominant tone despite graphic violence fullfrontal nudity jury takes air madefortv quickie real punch depth 
 problems jury run deeper technical 
 central fault updating mike hammer whose character lost shuffle updating fifties eighties 
 spillane wrote hammer mysteries first person hammers character central tale events filtered persona 
 never really get impression movie firstperson voiceover narration scenes dont hammer 
consequently great deal texture spillanes storytelling lost 
 period updating turns detrimentally bad idea much hammers moral code thrown wind 
despite characterization hardnosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently moral code 
 title jury refers antiestablishment notion law 
unlike private eyes seek bad guys turn police hammer pursues criminal exacts punishment 
 way can seen law still adheres strictly personal code conduct morality 
 movie forgoes aspect character hammer comes amoral societys terms terms especially 
 anything hammer always professionalism movie away first three minutes showing rolling sack wife client paid find wife unfaithful 
maybe scene intended laughs cheapens hammers character accounts lousy way start movie 
 blame hammers character cant laid assantes shoulders despite unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling delivers fine performance 
spillane never described hammers physical attributes dozen books appeared actor conceivably portray 
 course lack written description read spillanes books will strong personal notion hammer looks like therefore almost screen incarnation will somehow fall short expectations spillane played character s girl hunters generally considered best film hammers 
 rest actors unnoteworthy 
 exceptions alan king paul sorvino everyone appeared jury upandcomers basically went nowhere 
many ended working television like carrera short stint dallas mideighties adds madefortv atmosphere film 
maybe someday someone will manage get right elements together make effective film rendition spillane book certainly
