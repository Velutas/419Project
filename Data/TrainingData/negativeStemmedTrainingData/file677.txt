bad bad 
bad 
 one word seems pretty much sums beyond valley dolls 
 summary isnt enough ta ta ta 
still havent got point 
 director russ meyers predilection casting attractive large breasted women ultimately expose aforementioned anatomical areas really one reason recommend even taking look movie 
 fact cowritten famed film critic roger ebert also responsible screenplay 
 watching movie will never able sit another one reviews gives movie thumbs bad writing straight face 
 movie stinks loud 
quite frankly movie deserves 
 parts bad almost funny 
 im giving 
 maybe generous 
right opening credits knew classa bomb hands 
 way credits actually shot distracting first scene see includes big breasted young woman chased guy nazi uniform 
 absolutely idea hell happening get explained later soon first scene cut completely unrelated scene 
 honest sat movie mesmerized just incredibly awful actually forgot seemingly place opening popped later film 
 quality writing rest film wouldnt surprised opening never explained 
 movie 
 ask 
like really matters 
ok goes 
 allgirl band headed kelly macnamara dolly reed friends go hollywood try gain foothold music industry 
 manage find success due much hooters anything else sure wasnt brutally bad singing voices movie chronicles lives change worse pressures fame get 
everything big egos booze drugs free flowing sex sends downward spiral 
 couple idiotic subplots thrown good measure fame one pretty much sums thing 
 creative standpoint nothing redeeming 
 abovementioned obsession big knockers russ meyer seemed 
 dialogue incredibly bad literally funny parts 
mr ebert generously thrown helpings hey man dig time favorite happening freaks 
now ask lines like can go wrong 
ebert tried inject many big words possible dialogue 
maybe thought make movie seem smarter 
 dont know big words world wouldnt able disguise bad writing even worse acting 
 wretched dialogue goes along well wretched quality everything else movie 
ive seen home movies directed better meyer managed turkey 
 fact one scene one van driving hollywood make fortunes really question meyer editors just suffered serious head injuries 
add directing writing music movie 
 almost got check sound system see broken pile crap emanating speakers 
 cast 
first lets start david gurian played harris manager band 
 got goofiest looking guy ever set foot front motion picture camera 
sadly acting doesnt come close making looks 
 following along point shouldnt surprise 
meyers stable well endowed girls also benefit fairly attractive go along assets 
dolly reed plays kelly leader band 
 surprise cast cup size talents 
 yes loose shirt times display impressive talents 
sadly ass almost large chest 
hey sexist movie im writing sexist review 
 former playboy playmate cynthia myers fairly small role casey one band members 
 goes along rest idiotic thinking movie 
meyer casts gorgeous playmate rack kill obviously acting talent nude scenes biggest disappointment 
sure russ now time get artsy throw well placed shadows 
 side fun lesbo scene 
 sound like im writing review porn magazine 
 hey ill admit reason actually managed sit damn movie catch look cynthia myers naked 
 since huge disappointment pretty much wasted two hours life turkey 
 thing can say movie stay away 
unless course want feel good knowing even pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert screwed least life 
 thinking checking double ds better just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures internet 
 movie avoided costs 
 even better idea might require video stores place warning box beyond valley dolls beware movie extremely hazardous common sense 
proceed extreme caution
