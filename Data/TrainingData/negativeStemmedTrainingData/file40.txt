moreau doubt interesting premise within grasp 
even production failed make 
 many characters put attention worst thing characters prioritized audience led believe particular character important know perishes rather 
ungloriously times 
perhaps redemption development beast people especially aissa balk human moreaus creations 
 two important characters montgomery dr moreau receive development area script fails miserably 
 screen time used character interaction development 
 really liked better say delved dr moreaus obsession montgomerys purpose story justification beastpeople rebel 
maybe nature screenplay incidently incorporate much action sequences film forced filmmakers cut long story short make action film anything else still summer movies marketable 
 special effects really nothing anyone shout

 h g wells classic really potential good film 
unfortunately adaptations still decide focus attention really bring important message makes entire essence story
