 haunting film confusing forgets true meaning horror film scare us 
 youve ever seen movie probably considering website know trivia post movie 
 things like illustrations guess movie facts film 
 one always like quot namequot joke try rename particular film 
 instance one playing haunting different titles film small soldiers 
 titles like little infantry can get fatigues smaller size 
well seeing haunting particular names well 
unfortunately can post one otherwise id getting pretty angry emails overprotective mothers 
 title confusing 
ok pretty bad title fits film perfectly 
 basically serves purpose combined dry dialogue boring confusing plot completes formula cinematic bomb 
liam neeson gets wrapped film without depth least phantom menace exciting depth 
 haunting nothing trash unfortunately will still make boatload money 
 rant rave bad film let point stress word bright spots film 
first house great looking 
 looks beautiful also dark spot 
 looks great hard frightened 
 something rears ugly head points film 
things look great looking awe instead scared straight 
haunted house films contain one element even slightly successful eerie 
 hill house eerie 
 beautiful least bit frightening 
ever heard lili taylor 
 film glad now 
 gives satisfactory performance film 
despite dry dialogue boringconfusing concept manages light screen every time appears unfortunately costars usually following right behind 
owen wilson plays luke cast member even close giving admirable performance taylor 
 basically comic relief character development poor areas 
 characters desperately underdeveloped 
wilson potential luke seems just needed add laughs 
liam neeson catherine zetajones suffer dialogue plot film 
 characters must suffer wicked mood swings scene turn ruthless compassionate scared brave whatnot 
 just believable final nail hauntings coffin 
 plot terrible 
 opening scene film important director makes obvious getting closeups things will play major role end film 
 sat film kept wondering film trying accomplish 
nell lili taylors character goes hunted savior 
 makes sense director gives audience reasoning ridiculous changes take place film 
 forces viewer make various assumptions give indepth information 
 instance beginning film gives us sense nell getting involved program 
 get zilch four 
plus two get wiped first ten minutes 
 worst part horror films killings 
 reason kill luke end film 
 reason whatsoever just head literally 
overall haunting epitome bad movie 
bad plot confusing storyline waste good talent 
hopefully liam neeson can rebound get good film used full potential 
hopefully lili taylor will recognized great job bad film 
 hopefully horror films blair witch project haunting hill house will bad one
