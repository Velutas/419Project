paul verhoevens last movie showgirls bad script bad acting plot use word loosest possible sense served allow lots sex nudity 
 stank 
starship troopers bad script bad acting plot serves allow lots violence gore 
 stinks 
nobody will watch movie plot heres brief synopsis anyway 
 friends straight high school sign federal reserve armed forces time evil bugs planet klendathu sending meteors towards earth side galaxy 
 one slips defences destroys buenos aires home city main characters war declared 
 involves sending grunts include johnny rico van dien dizzy meyer surface bugs planet 
much carnage ensues 
 troops withdrawn sent another planet answer distress call 
 carnage ensues 
 rescued plans changed capture brain bug believed controlling aliens battle plans look didnt write ok 
yet carnage ensues 
get picture 
interspersed throughout brief ads federal network present picture neofascist state much like verhoevens robocop 
 many problems starship troopers 
 plot one exists drive movie onwards silly 
harris star tvs doogie howser md presented psychic ability talk ferret early movie apparently will accept ability mindmeld brain bug later 
 addition first thirty minutes movie characters sign service drag like bad episode beverly hills 
 characters onedimensional much dizzy killed says ok got sleep rico 
 hoped verhoevens use noname cast allow kill several lead characters surprise audience idea appears escaped 
 dialogue embarassing isnt helped frequently terrible delivery almost burst laughing harris delivered speech need sacrifice hundred people good species 
finally fake ads become nuisance 
although evoke propaganda wwiiera movietone reels presumably meant complete lack subtlety blunts effect 
 people will say thats irrelevant movie hinges battle scenes 
 battle scenes 
well admit effects good bugs move quite convincingly especially deprived limbs 
 people brains blown limbs cut bodies ripped two quite impressive ways 
 problem 
 entertainment value film rests almost entirely graphic portrayal gore continous attempt gross us starting early richards character vomits onscreen 
verhoeven appears trying make movie employing elements made robocop success fails spectacularly 
 robocop message importance human gave bad guys motivation starship troopers lacks even simple features 
 brain bug sucks characters brain near end film merely analogy film done us 
 film full graphic violence suitable children
