one might expect cathartic viewing experience walking new jeanluc godard film 
 founding member highly influential french new wave 
 also esteemed film critic lending intelligence historical perspective us much writing 
however latest creation praise love possibly exasperating film experience year 
 abstract concept film based merit dissect love following four categories meeting physical passion quarrels reconciliation 
 four universal truths revealed three different couples young adult elderly 
 edgars bruno putzulu selfappointed task capture moments recent breakup define central idea things make sense 
whether project will end play film opera remains undecided 
 thesis simple enough played right really hold sympathetic value anyone 
instead ensues hour half repetitive vignettes next scene engaging last 
 character utter something worthwhile time happens youre thoroughly bored can easily miss 
 dont fret will surface 
 easily sleep whole sections film fellow critics wake scene exactly like one nodded missed anything worthwhile 
 hold hope time 
 background music keeps state urgency even suspense first conversations 
 repeated failures pay lose hope 
 speeches like thinking something can think something thinking something else can expect hold anyones interest 
 godards credit certainly knows frame scene 
 black white footage used first half film starkly beautiful 
watching edgar read walking along train track mountain makes wish something ponder along 
 film anything poignant say makes angrier numerous missed opportunities 
 environments city country impeccably captured crisp detail script never complements 
unfortunately godard also manages pillage photographic eye randomly cutting black numerous times within given scene 
sometimes breaks used chapter headings even cryptic spoken words 
 second half composed nauseating hypercolor often blurs image 
 suddenly feel like doomed character straight scanners 
 scene makes sense one complains united states bastardizing history making movies 
steven spielberg picked particular 
 ill grant happen tend shy away watching garbage still pointless focus film purports articulate specific qualities couplehood 
 just goes show intelligent person isnt necessarily admirable storyteller 
 days breathless
