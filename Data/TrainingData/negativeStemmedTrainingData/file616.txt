im going start review hypothetical question 
lets say youve just car accident driver vehicle unconscious 
 friends left go get help youre waiting see victim wakes 
 towtruck comes along driver hops truck see whats going 
 proceeds kill unconscious victim snapping neck 
 
 run away screaming life staying away main road 
b run away fast stay main road even madman truck starts following stop catch breath try negotiate psycho fails start running away staying main road 
 answered far intelligent screenwriter texas chainsaw massacre next generation will likely hate movie 
however answered b prepare enjoy film made idiots like mind 
 texas chainsaw massacre next generation called sequel really remake original 
theres changes essentially even infamous meathook scene recreated 
 story opens four teenagers hitting road night prom somehow ending middle nowhere 
needless say soon encounter leatherface nutty family 
much carnage ensues 
 call movie inept putting mildly 
 addition laughably idiotic situation mentioned hypothetical question moment towards end film one baddies killed airplane literally comes nowhere 
 just swoops kills wheel 
 explantion given flying heshe going around killing people planes wheel 
 dialogue even atrocious 
zellwegger kidnapped family early keeps trying normal conversations people 
 youre surrounded maniacs wielding chainsaws dead corpses think rationality go window 
speaking going window scene zellwegger jumps window 
apparently stunt double little trouble visibly gets stuck window 
 director quickly cuts wide shot stunt double doesnt get caught window 
 one many glaring inconsistencies 
 many fact name review several pages long 
 reason giving movie one star instead stars matthew mcconaughey 
 plays member family hydraulic leg homemade might add completely overthetop cant help amazed performance 
 obviously lot fun part really shows 
 makes jack nicholsons portrayal psychotic inn keeper shining look restrained comparison 
 horror movie texas chainsaw massacre next generation contains surprisingly little gore 
 fact contains none 
theres little blood thats far goes 
 leads believe budget must astonishingly low shows 
everything movie looks cheap sets costumes 
especially leatherface 
 frightening nightmare inducing hes now terrifying dame edna 
 favor take pass remake 
check far superior original instead
