 judge film bad intentionally 
 spiceworld highly popular singing group spice girls accomplish major goal mocking purposely cheezy film lot fun 
 goal fantastic job 
 fair give low grade wasnt really meant much better 
honestly id rather see film many others gave higher grades mean graded inaccurately 
truth known dont really think can answer question 
 understand spiceworld understand spice girls 
unless youre young fairly older probably least heard 
theyre group five busty british babes whove hit singles whose debut album sold millions 
theyre primarily adored preteen girls hope someday contents training bras might match ginger spices real name geri haliwell wonderbra 
 five girls spicy names better known real names 
 aforementioned ginger spice well sporty spice melanie chisholm mel c scary spice melanie brown mel b baby spice emma bunton posh spice victoria addams degree another resemble stage names 
 spice girls took world storm spiceworld actually good humored spoof transpired quick rise fame 
 quite nice see good sports girls just one dubbed sporty poking fun 
 dont take seriously thats probably best thing 
 also surprising natural seem front camera acting just singing dancing 
theyre flawless means part deliver lines without feeling staged like get sense five home within characters seems reasonable since portray 
 makes film bad extreme fans spice girls wont get enough music rest us dont get enough movie 
 real point look spice girls ninety straight minutes 
 film blas several parts downright boring sporadic moments actually make us laugh loud 
 youre big fan group probably wont get enough want youre big fan get much time devoted nothing look us moments 
 right crowd music video sequences will highlights film others will serve threeminute lulls hecticbutoveralluneventful storyline 
 key actors include richard e grant clifford spice girls manager alan cumming filmmaker piers cuthertonsmyth attempts make documentary group george wendt martin barnfield producer constantly works pitching spice girls movie roger moore small selfparodizing role 
 provide relatively good performances keeping mind film wasnt meant acted seriously 
even meat loaf shows dennis bus driver seems fun 
 film continuously compared beatles hard days night think unjust comparison 
 supposedly movie studio first mad comparison way press kits dont think drector bob spiers spice girls intended 
 think studios just trying boost hype interest film instead come rather pretentious 
 dont think film trying anything fun satirical look group got big movie seemed next likely step 
 couldve better selfindulged yet self mocking approach 
probably nothing 
spiceworld movie thought embarrassing enjoy now instead find wanting defend movie didnt even give good review 
 bad succeeds every way intended 
 gives spice girls chance play allowing obsessive fans indulge every brainless moment 
perhaps group nothing gimmick 
 thats case movies gimmick gimmick 
 might saying spice girls movie 
come comes think thats point
