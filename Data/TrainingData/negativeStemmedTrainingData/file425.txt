 time take cover 
 hiatus fifteen years disaster movie come back renewed zest 
 early less three movies volcanoes alone one television two theaters dantes peak volcano heavy competition moviegoing dollar 
 two heard dantes peak better film decided check released video 
 film begins slow motion scene people third world country trying evacuate little town 
 town covered ash sulfuric water presume volcanic eruption 
flaming rocks various sizes also fall sky crushing homes people 
 see people panicking people crying even horses rearing 
 disaster biblical proportions signified us one person dragging cross road 
symbolism doesnt get much blatant 
 learn harry dalton pierce brosnan volcanologist u s geological survey wife eruption occurred 
harry survived wife 
 years later harry sent investigate unusual seismic activity detected near small town dantes peak washington told voted second desirable place live readers money magazine 
 harry meets rachel wando single mother two serves mayor dantes peak proprietor small coffee shop 
although mayor doesnt seem alarmed presence man sent determine mountain next town going blow members city council 
 afraid harrys presence going scare investor pledged put millions dollars developing dantes peak 
 rather news possible stirrings within neighboring dormant volcano swept rug 
however amorous young couple takes skinnydip local hot springs turn cooked lava bubbles small fissure underneath 
thus begins chain events leading inevitable eruption 
 film contains number cliches 
 amorous couple one 
 soon doff clothes know theyre going die 
 town busybody abrasive motherinlaw make appearances deathdefying dog 
countless familiar scenarios serve make film predictable 
watching movie able anticipate major plot elements dialogue well 
unfortunate since much dialog terrible 
 example harrys boss paul charles hallahan team u s geological survey join harry assess situation 
paul basically tells townsfolk harrys eruption predictions arent cause alarm 
 causes harry leave fit rage turn next day ready work 
 paul asks harry stayed says grim determination cause towns trouble im best man youve got 
even better harry trying explain need jolt residents leaving 
 likens situation frog will jump dropped pot boiling water 
 frog cold water gradually heated however frog wont move will allow cooked 
 recipe frog soup 
asks one team members 
 recipe disaster responds harry 
dantes peak singular talent pointing obvious 
 heroes boat middle lake harry realizes volcanic activity turned acid 
mayor wando demonstrates brilliant powers deduction proclaiming grave tone acid eats metal 
thanks tip 
 first see u s geological survey building theres caption labeling 
 wouldnt bad werent fact caption right sign building reads large letters u s geological survey 
 suppose caption people cant read signs 
although harry mayor wando become item end film viewer idea 
 severe lack chemistry two characters relationship seems rushed 
 get close kissing asking want kiss 
 even attracted 
 mayor sure think twice kissing guy doesnt even crack smile whole movie trying pull roughyetdebonair act 
 think 
james bond 
 eruption volcano feels similarly rushed 
 several warning signs prior eruption lackluster without suspense dont feel leading anything 
 example one survey team members makes way crater volcano order retrieve remote controlled robot 
 tremor occurs 
 plunge headlong death 
 engulfed lava shoots 
 couple rocks fall break leg 
 sole purpose scene seemed set subsequent chopper rescue scene suppose intended dramatic well 
 wasnt 
one plot thread left noticeably hanging investment town dantes peak 
 disaster movie theres usually one guy whos greedy enough cover possibility eruptionfireearthquakeexplosiontsunamitornadometeorite usually gets killed disaster 
 okay course think got deserved 
 youre going unoriginal might well go way 
 dantes peak city councilmembers concerned dont really try hard enough 
maybe mayors abrasive motherinlaw one 
 apparent reason snaps harry even positing volcano erupt 
perhaps ancestors invested pompeii real estate 
 couple good things movie 
 first scenery 
 panoramic shots forests lakes mountains absolutely beautiful 
 second special effects 
 closest ive ever seen real pyroclastic eruption 
 elements dont speak going best parts movie youd probably better rewrite script
